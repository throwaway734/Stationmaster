{reputation > 20}The Traveler
You are going about your normal duties when you are distracted by the sudden awareness of an unauthorized space ship materializing aboard your station. [Addslave|Kiss-o-gram from a primitive world|You enslaved her]
	Watch the strangers
		The strangers appear to be scandalized when they see the state of the slaves on your station, and immediately attempt to start a revolution. Your slaves are far too smart to join a random stranger under your eyes though, and your security drones quickly descend on both the man and his companion.
		The man pulls out a small metal stick and manages to disable one of your drones, but they are far too numerous, and he is quickly overwhelmed. The woman surrenders without a fight after seeing the brutal power of your drones, and they drag her away for processing.
		Your drones attempt to execute the man, but he has some form of failsafe that you're not familiar with. After they tear him limb from limb, he dissolves into dust, and reassembles himself as a woman. You shrug and have the drones drag her away for processing as well. [Addslave|Nigh-indestructible alien with extra organs|You enslaved her with her companion after they appeared in a mysterious spacecraft|20/23|80/100|80/100][select|1]
	Incinerate the strangers
		You simply seal off the corridor that they landed in, and incinerate it. The woman is reduced to dust immediately, but the man dissolves into a glowing storm of nanites several times before eventually joining his companion in the ashes. You have a security drone analyze their ship, which was bizarrely unaffected by the intense heat. It appears to be indestructible and impossible to open, so you jettison it from the station to avoid any surprises.[remove]


The first line is the title of the event. This is what displays in the notification bar. A condition in this line (displayed {like this} ) that is not met will make the randomizer choose a different event.
The second line is the initial text that is displayed.
For all future lines, the progression is driven by indentation:
  Lines indented at the next level (one tab) will be options shown on dialog buttons
    The next level will be system response
    A second line at the same indentation level will be presented after a "next" button
      And so on.
  {slave}This will present as another dialog option, but only if the selected character is a slave
    And this will be presented as the response to that choice.


All conditions in an event title or dialog option must evaluate to true for the event or option to be available.
SlaveInspection.txt has more of these than anything else, if you want to see a sample.
