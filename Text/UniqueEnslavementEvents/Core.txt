Ascendant
You receive a signal from an ancient ship. According to the message, it was trapped near a black hole for hundreds of years, and the crew is still coming to grips with how much the universe has changed since they were abruptly removed. The captain is not taking this well, and is attempting to reconstruct their long-dead home empire through sheer force of will. He's clearly unstable, but his ship is a valuable antique, and he has some crew members who would look good in your brothel.[AddSlave|Had a troublesome prehensile tail, but your drones amputated it|She was a crew member aboard a ship on a quixotic mission until you enslaved her.|1200/1500|0/0|50/90|Trance|virgin|purpleskin/brunette/slight/short/smallbreasts/smallass/hatessex][environment|holo]
	Ambush the party as they come aboard to discuss the alliance
		You cordially invite them aboard your station. When they arrive, you immediately lock down their ship and have your drones capture the crew. You space the crew members who aren't slave material, and have the rest collared the rest for processing. It was a dishonest act, and your reputation will suffer slightly, but the ship was well worth the cost, and you will enjoy breaking in the crew.[AddSlave|Headstrong|She was a crew member aboard a ship on a quixotic mission.

	Have your security drones show them how far technology has come (costs $100,000).
		You don't respond to the signal, but instead dispatch a small fleet of security drones to the source location. You watch from their cameras as they latch onto the ship, tearing through its ancient hull like so much tissue paper. They efficiently massacre the majority of the crew, and collar the survivors for processing. Although the valuable ship was destroyed in the assault, the sheer dominance of your security drones in combat strikes fear into your enemies. As an added bonus, you now have some pretty new slaves to play with. [AddSlave|Headstrong|She was a crew member aboard a ship on a quixotic mission.

	Ignore them.
		They are mentally unstable and heavily armed, a dangerous combination. You ignore them, and they find someone else to bother with their grand ideals.[remove]

Out of Gas
You've received a distress signal. A freighter of a type that is favored by small-time smugglers has lost life support, and is drifting near your station. The ship itself is almost worthless in its current state, but the people aboard are subject to salvage laws.[environment|holo]
	Send a ship to help them. (Costs $5,000)
		You take the time to meet the refugees as they arrive on your station. They appear to be awestruck by the wealth of the place. They thank you profusely for the rescue, and use what little money they have to buy parts and book passage to their ship for repairs. They spread word of your generosity through their extensive travels, and your reputation is bolstered by the positive attention.[rep|50][money|-5000]
	Send a ship to capture them. (Costs $5,000)
		The refugees initially appear grateful, but that gratitude immediately turns to fear as, instead of being led to the spaceport, they are sorted. Those that are not slave material are immediately spaced, while the rest are collared and processed.[AddSlave|Was a High-Class prostitute|She was rescued from a derelict smuggling ship and summarily enslaved|20/30|50/80|40/70|Inara|nonvirgin/blackhair/midbuild/midbreasts/midass/longhair/likessex/fearful/easygoing/midskin][AddSlave|Hardened Veteran|She was rescued from a derelict smuggling ship and summarily enslaved|25/35|35/35|0/0|Zoe|nonvirgin|defiant/fearless/hatessex/ripped/tall/midbreasts/smallass/blackhair/longhair/darkskin][AddSlave|Mechanically Inclined|She was rescued from a derelict smuggling ship and summarily enslaved|20/20|75/75|80/100|Kaylee|nonvirgin|longhair/brunette/largebreasts/midbuild/short/largeass/lightskin/fearful][AddSlave|Failed Military Experiment|She was rescued from a derelict smuggling ship and summarily enslaved|min/18|0/0|0/0|River|virgin|insane/hatessex/lightskin/brunette/longhair/largeass/smallbreasts/midbuild][clothe]
	Take no action.
		The distress signal repeats for a long while, but eventually fades out as the transmitter loses power. Your station's sensors eventually stop picking up life signs. It was not the first ship to die in space, and it won't be the last.

Warp Gate Attack
The galaxy is a chaotic and dangerous place, and it's not uncommon for planets to lose access to it, either by choice or by the ravages of warfare. Your station has detected one such world. Its people have barely regained the ability for basic space flight, but they have discovered a warp gate from before their collapse, and are using it to launch raids on slaveholding planets. Their weapons are too primitive to do any real damage, but they occasionally manage to liberate a group of slaves or kill an un-augmented citizen. One of their teams finally arrived on your station, and was immediately massacred by a security drone, but not before it sent a signal back home, and it's likely that they will be back with a larger force. It's generally frowned-upon to burn planets, but nobody important would miss this one.
	Burn their world
		The team arrives as expected (though, unexpectedly, there were only four of them), but you are ready for them, and your security drones quickly restrain them. They attempt to negotiate for their release, but you simply direct their attention to the gate, where a maintenance bot is preparing to drive an antimatter bomb. They begin to struggle and beg you to reconsider, and you notice that one of them is a woman. Immediately after the bomb materializes on thier planet, it detonates, and the portal abruptly closes as their gate, along with their entire world, is annihilated. You show them the feed of their world being destroyed through a strategically-located screen near your warp gate, and they simultaneously cry out in grief. You approach the woman and lightly stroke her cheek as your drones drag the three men out the airlock. She spits at you, so you punch her in the stomach before you have her dragged away for processing. The galactic community tacitly appreciates your handling of the aggressive world, though most would never admit it.[rep|-50][inf|100][addslave|Talented researcher|She attacked your station through a warp gate, so you made her watch you destroy her world before enslaving her.|26/36|0/0|40/60|Sam|Nonvirgin|midbuild/hatessex/fearless/defiant/largebreasts/midass/blond/shorthair/lightskin][clothe]
	Send a security drone in return, and see if there is anyone worth enslaving
		The next time they open the gate, you send a small ship containing a single security drone to their world. As soon as it arrives, it tears its way through their primitive forces, simultaneously blocking their escape and throwing any women it finds through the portal. The away team was restrained as soon as it arrived, and is forced to watch helplessly as their female comrades materialize on your station, caked in the blood and viscera of their less-fortunate counterparts. When your drone has completed its rampage, it returns to your station, leaving a small charge behind. The portal abruptly closes as their facility is destroyed, and you're left with a nice haul of new slaves. Your drones drag the women away for processing, and the men of the away team are simply spaced.[rep|-50][inf|100][addslave|Talented researcher|She attacked your station through a warp gate, but was easily defeated by your security drones.|26/36|0/0|40/60|Sam|Nonvirgin|midbuild/hatessex/fearless/defiant/largebreasts/midass/blond/shorthair/lightskin][inf|40][addslave|Career military|She was a soldier in a primitive military base that launched an attack on your station.

Your drone raided the base and enslaved her.|26/36|0/0|40/60] 
	Go to their base of operations in person to take your revenge
		You decide to have some fun dealing with the problem personally. You don your power armor, and as soon as you see the the gate open, you start a running charge. The away team (surprisingly only four people) arrives, and is immediately thrown back through the gate by your momentum. You land in a military base, and you begin your assault. There are several soldiers surrounding you, with their primitive guns pointed at you. Beneath you are two of the away team members, a man and a woman. Before anyone has a chance to react, you reach down and crush the man's skull in your hand, and bend the steel walkway around the woman's waist, leaving her pinned on her back for later. You then  your way through the incompetant guards, ignoring the prospect of capture and simply tearing them limb from limb as their bullets bounce harmlessly off your armor. Floor by floor, you clear the building, slaughtering indiscriminantly. Eventually, your suit's sensors report only one life sign in the facility, the woman you left bound on the catwalk. [addslave|Talented researcher|She attacked your station through a warp gate, so you made her watch you murder everyone in her home base before enslaving her.|26/36|0/0|40/60|Sam|Nonvirgin|midbuild/hatessex/fearless/defiant/largebreasts/midass/blond/shorthair/lightskin][clothe]
		As you arrive at the gate, she is desperately trying to escape the crude bindings, but she is helplessly pinned. You walk up to her and, as she begins to recite her name, rank, and serial number, you tear her pants off. As you return for her panties, she kicks and struggles, fighting desperately to keep them, but you simply tear them off from the front. You grab a thigh in each hand and spread her legs before forcing yourself into her. She may be brave, but she still screams in pain as you rape her, the bare metal cutting into her with each thrust. By the time you've finished in her, her facade has evaporated, and she's reduced to a sobbing mess on the ground. You unpin her before dragging her through the gate by her hair and handing her to a drone for processing. [strip]

The Traveler
You are going about your normal duties when you are distracted by the sudden awareness of an unauthorized space ship materializing aboard your station. It superficially appears to be an ancient phone booth, but the fact that it was able to so easily bypass your defenses is unnerving. Almost immediately, a man and a woman emerge and begin to look around. It's obvious that they are unaware of where they are, and the man is carefully examining the environment. As they step through the door, you immediately see that the box is larger on the inside.[Addslave|Kiss-o-gram from a primitive world|You enslaved her with her companion after they appeared in a mysterious spacecraft|20/23|80/100|80/100]
	Watch the strangers
		The strangers appear to be scandalized when they see the state of the slaves on your station, and immediately attempt to start a revolution. Your slaves are far too smart to join a random stranger under your eyes though, and your security drones quickly descend on both the man and his companion. 
		The man pulls out a small metal stick and manages to disable one of your drones, but they are far too numerous, and he is quickly overwhelmed. The woman surrenders without a fight after seeing the brutal power of your drones, and they drag her away for processing.
		Your drones attempt to execute the man, but he has some form of failsafe that you're not familiar with. After they tear him limb from limb, he dissolves into dust, and reassembles himself as a woman. You shrug and have the drones drag her away for processing as well. [Addslave|Nigh-indestructible alien with extra organs|You enslaved her with her companion after they appeared in a mysterious spacecraft|20/23|80/100|80/100][select|1]
	Incinerate the strangers
		You simply seal off the corridor that they landed in, and incinerate it. The woman is reduced to dust immediately, but the man dissolves into a glowing storm of nanites several times before eventually joining his companion in the ashes. You have a security drone analyze their ship, which was bizarrely unaffected by the intense heat. It appears to be indestructible and impossible to open, so you jettison it from the station to avoid any surprises.[remove]

Warehouse
Your systems register an incoming wormhole from a very old style of warp gate. You use your cameras to look through, and see a primitive warehouse on the other side. It is full of ancient artifacts and relics, and their gate appears to be a rare leftover from before their planet was disconnected from the galactic community. There is a small group of people staring in, trying to make sense of your gate room.[addslave|Artifact keeper from a primitive world|Unknowingly activated a warp gate, leading your security drones to capture her and detonate her warehouse|18/18|40/60|80/90||V][addslave|Artifact collector from a primitive world|Unknowingly activated a warp gate, leading your security drones to capture her and detonate her warehouse|25/30|0/0|0/0||V]
	Storm the warehouse
		You send a few drones through the gate to secure the other end. The denizens of the far side panic when they see the oncoming machines, but are not familiar enough with the portal to shut it down in time to stop the assault. No natural human would stand a chance against the drones, and these archivists are no exception. Seconds after the fighting has started, it has ended with your opponents trapped by the tentacles of your soldiers.
		You run a cursory inventory of the warehouse's contents. Most of it is garbage, but there are items housed here that could seriously alter the balance of power on such a primitive world, and even some that could prove dangerous to members of the galactic community, in the right hands.
		As is standard procedure, you take the enslaveable workers with you, and leave the rest behind with a small antimatter warhead.
		The warhead detonates as the portal closes, and scans indicate that the entire warehouse, along with a twenty-mile radius sphere around it, has been reduced to inert glass.
	Close the portal
		You have a security drone throw a charge through the portal. It detonates, destroying the gate on the other end, but leaving the inhabitants of the primitive world alive. Contact with the outside world is dangerous for primitive societies, and it would be better for them if they took the time to rediscover portal technology on their own.

Containment Breach
You have developed a slightly annoying problem. A laboratory on a relatively primitive world has apparently discovered a warp gate from before their collapse. It's not a terribly rare occurrence on its own, but this laboratory is annoyingly diligent. They have what seems like a daily ritual of sending criminally-insane men in orange jumpsuits through the gate. You destroy the interlopers, of course, but this only seems to encourage the researchers on the other end. More drastic measures must be taken.
	See if you can get something better from them
		You open the portal from your end, and send an especially-intimidating security drone through. Through your drone, you threaten to destroy their world unless they send a regular supply of female tributes instead. 
		The agents on the other side open fire on the drone, but their primitive weapons have no effect. After a few moments, they stop, and you see one of the scientists making a note on a clipboard. Another nods, and timidly asks if there's anything else. Your drone silently returns to your station, and the portal closes.
		A few hours later, the portal opens once again, and a young woman emerges, dressed in the same orange jumpsuit. She is obviously terrified, and hands a note to your security drone before it leads her away for processing.[addslave|Entered your station with an orange jumpsuit reading "D-32745"|A tribute paid by a faraway research facility|18/25|0/0|40/60]
		The note reads:[br]Item: SCP-4732[br]Object class: Euclid[br]Special Containment Procedures: Item SCP-4732 is to be kept in a 30 by 30 foot concrete cell, and left in its unpowered "Idle" state unless procedure SCP-4732-A is in process.[br]Procedure SCP-4732-A: Once per month, SCP-4732 is to be powered, and 1 (one) female D-Class personnel under the age of 25 is to be sent through the wormhole. Failure to complete this process could lead to an XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario.[br]Description: SCP-4732 is a virtually-indestructable metallic circle that, when powered, opens a portal to a metal chamber (believed to be aboard an advanced space station). Shortly after the artifact's acquisition, several D-class personnel were sent through the gate in an attempt to ascertain more about the destination, but all contact was lost moments after they arrived.[br][br]On <REDACTED>, the wormhole opened of its own accord, and a large tentacled machine (SCP-4732-1) entered the containment chamber. Foundation personnel immediately opened fire, but standard-issue weapons had no visible effect on its casing.[br]SCP-4732-1 demanded that we send a regular supply of female personnel through the gate, and threatened the annihilation of our world should we fail to comply. Given the unknown nature of the beings on the other side of the wormhole (and the relatively small cost of compliance), it was deemed necessary to comply with its demands (and upgrade SCP-4732 from "Safe" to "Euclid" status).[br][br]Document #4732-a: This should be added to our training materials as a cautionary tale. We can't keep blindly sending people through strange portals. Now we've attracted the attention of yet another abomination from beyond the stars, and I don't even want to think about why it specifically wants women.[br][br]Dr. <REDACTED>[Set|FoundationTricked]
	Bomb their facility
		You're in no mood for this. You simply send an antimatter bomb back through the portal next time they send one of their criminals. You hear brief sounds of panic from the other end before you close the portal, and can be assured that there will be no more interlopers.
	Allow the annoyance to continue
		What's a little harmless extermination? You continue to slaughter their convicts, and some citizens even camp out in front of the gate to watch the spectacle. After a few dozen, the researchers on the other end appear to be satisfied that they won't learn anything, and the experiments cease.
