First Contact
As you sit at your desk, you see your screen go black, replaced by a message in stark white text.
"This cycle nears completion. We grant power. We demand conquest."
"From death, new life. From insanity, comprehension. From Entropy, ascension."
The message disappears as suddenly as it appeared, leaving no evidence of its existence.
You notice that the blueprints for your ships have been altered. They are visually identical to the old designs, but there are significant changes to the internal systems. 
They seem to be reliant on unknown physical principles, so it's impossible to know exactly how they will function. Based on what you can understand, however, it looks as though the entity has granted you a staggering advantage.
