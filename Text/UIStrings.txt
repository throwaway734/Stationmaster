SlaveIdleTrainTitle|Slave Idle

InsufficientGateTitle|Insufficient Gates

BuildRoomTitle|Tutorial
BuildRoom|[showassistant]Welcome to Stationmaster![br]To build a room, select a type with one of the buttons on the right, and click and drag on the grid to place it.[br][br]Generally, you'll want to start by encouraging tourists to visit. To do that, build a port and a bar.[br][br]If you would like more information, press F1 or the "Help" button under the settings menu to view the encyclopedia.
BuildFurnTitle|Tutorial
BuildFurn|[showassistant]To build furniture, click on a room, and use the buttons on the right hand side to select an item. Hold shift to build more than one.[br][br]To start, build a gate in your port to allow tourists to visit, and a restaurant in your bar to give them something to do while they're here.
SlaveTutorialTitle|Tutorial
SlaveTutorial|[showassistant]Bars are entertaining enough, but tourists will give you a lot more money for a brothel.[br][br]To set up your brothel, start by building the room and some private rooms (for obedient slaves) or arcade stations (for disobedient slaves). Once you have those, use the shopping cart icon in the top left of the screen to buy some slaves to fill them.[br][br]Note that slaves with high obedience won't staff arcade stations, and slaves with low obedience won't staff private rooms.
DemoSlavesTitle|Free Limit
DemoSlaves|The free version of Stationmaster is limited to 10 purchased slaves. You can always try raiding for them though.

Raiding Strings:

TakeoverVictory|After a long battle, your forces managed to break through [body]'s defenses and conquer the world.
Defeat|After a long battle, your forces were eventually defeated by planetary security. You lose connection as the last of your ships is destroyed. [body]'s government lives another day.

EasyDefeat|You knew that it was a long shot going in, but the efficiency with which the defenses of [body] defeated your army was remarkable. You almost immediately lose connection as the last of them is wiped out. [body] will not be yours today.

RivalVictory|You have successfully conquered [owner]. They were a powerful foe, and your victory over them has instilled respect and fear in the rest of the galaxy.

Without their headquarters on [body], their defenses across the galaxy will be significantly weakened.
RivalHomeworld|You have successfully conquered the headquarters of [owner], but most of their leadership managed to flee to a new world. You managed to pick up a few high-ranking stragglers, but the corporate government is still in place.
TributeVignette|The government of [body] responds immediately to your demand for tribute, and delivers [name] for your inspection.[clothe]

You have reduced her to a gibbering mess, and the rest of your slaves react as if you had killed her.[globalobedience|5][globalfear|5]
LobotomyText|[name] wakes up and looks out with a blank expression, any remnant of her personality erased by the surgery. She will never be a functioning human, and the rest of your slaves react as if you had killed her.[globalobedience|5][globalfear|5]


Planet Upgrade Vignettes:
BasicDefenseGridVignette|You send a large number of drones into orbit around [body]. They won't stop a serious attack, but should be enough to deter skirmishers.
AdvancedDefenseGridVignette|You send a grid of missile batteries into orbit around [body]. They should deter most attacks, but won't be enough to repel a major assault.
StandbyFleetVignette|You order several warships and place them in orbit around [body]. Between them and the defense grid, it will now be difficult to seize from your control. 
StandingArmyVignette|Surveillance systems pick up long lines as every able-bodied citizen is forced to register for the draft. Invaders will now have to slaughter most of the population to take the world.
BusinessInvestmentVignette|You carefully invest money in the best-run business on [body]. The investment doesn't pay for itself, but the effect on the economy is significant.
SellHuntingLicensesVignette|It's not long before you are flooded with wealthy tourists who are eager to hunt the citizens of [body]. There are mass protests, but it won't be too long before the citizens recognize their new predation as a fact of life.
ModestProposalVignette|The people of [body] are obviously horrified at the new policy (and initially resist the meat quotas), but people are adaptable, and it soon becomes an ordinary part of life.
ThoughtPoliceVignette|Your AI-assisted thought police are as effective as they are brutal. They arrest and "disappear" thousands of dissidents in the first months of the policy, but it drops off quickly as your people learn the dangers of independent thought.
DruggedWaterSupplyVignette|The drugs are effective, and crime statistics show that sedition and violence are both substantially reduced. A few holdouts find their own ways of acquiring water, but not enough to have an impact on the statistics.
StrictRationingVignette|The morale effects of the rationing are significant, but people soon learn to tighten their belts and accept the borderline malnutrition you have inflicted on them.
FitnessPropagandaVignette|Daily mandatory workouts soon get the people of [body] into great shape. The relatively low cost of compliance limits resistance, and the population quickly becomes athletic.
UniversalHealthcareVignette|Universal immortality is excellent for most economic indicators (except for class mobility, of course, but a permanent underclass is useful in its own way).
CarouselVignette|You are forced to deploy legions of drones and massive subterfuge to enforce the first rounds of the Carousel, but it ultimately takes hold, and the people begin to accept the necessity. 
SlaveFactoryVignette|The slave factory is not something that can be built overnight, but your people begin the construction of their prison.
FreeUseVignette|There are riots when you announce the new laws around sexual consent, but many among the population welcome the change, and it isn't long before the culture has adapted to the new norms of a free use society.
SalvageDronesVignette|The new salvage drones rapidly orbit the planet, searching for any and all wreckage. With these in place, war may actually be profitable.
FelisColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Felis for the foreseeable future.
CanisColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Canis for the foreseeable future.
FaeColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Fae for the foreseeable future.
CoralColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Eoll for the foreseeable future.
LoGravColonyVignette|You deploy an gravity canceling device to the planet, and babies born immediately begin to show the signs of low-gravity gestation. The population should be converted shortly.
TuskedColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Tusked for the foreseeable future.
AtaranColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Atarans for the foreseeable future.
EkoColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Eko for the foreseeable future.
BovaColonyVignette|You deploy an expensive bioweapon, extinguishing all human life on [body]. After that, it's a simple matter to seed the planet with a few hundred breeding pairs. They should produce a steady supply of Bova for the foreseeable future.
TerraformLavaVignette|Thousands of rented lasers pour thermal energy into the core of [body]. Within hours, the crust begins to crack and lava from the core begins to erupt planet-wide. 
TerraformSandVignette|Thousands of industrial desiccators make short work of the water on [body]. It isn't long before the surface of the world is purged of liquid.
TerraformTerrestrialVignette|It's a long and expensive process, but you manage to seed [body] with life and all of the conditions to keep it. The people thank you profusely for the investment.
TerraformOceanicVignette|You direct several icy comets to the surface of [body], quickly submerging it in a thick ocean. The remaining population is forced to live in floating cities.
TerraformThunderstormVignette|You import colossal amounts of material from neighboring gas giants, increasing the density of the atmosphere enough to make it opaque. The citizens who remain are forced to live in cities floating high in the toxic gas cloud.
TerraformIceVignette|You disperse a large amount of high-albedo particulate matter into the atmosphere. In a matter of months, the lack of sunlight freezes the planet over.
BlackHairEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have black hair.
BlondeEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have blonde hair.
BrunetteEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have brunette hair.
RedheadEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have red hair.
DarkSkinEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have dark skin.
MidSkinEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have olive skin.
LightSkinEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have light skin.
LargeBreastsEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have large breasts.
MidBreastsEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have average breasts.
SmallBreastsEugenicsVignette|You apply the genetic modifications to the population of [body]. The existing population is cheaply modified, and any new citizens will have small breasts.
ShipyardVignette|After a few weeks of construction, the automated systems of the shipyard take over, assembling the rest in a matter of days. It will conduct maintenance and repairs for the rest of the military, drastically increasing the speed at which it will recover from attack.
GenocideStoneVignette|As soon as the last piece is placed onto the device, it dissolves into a cloud of nanites. They crash outward like a tidal wave, indiscriminately shredding the panicked citizens, dissolving them into a thick red sludge. Once the population has been reduced to exactly a thousand, the swarm retreats and returns to the form of the Genocide Stone.


Eye of Entropy
EyeOfEntropyPlanet|The Eye of Entropy crackles for a few moments before emitting a blast of radiation. Moments later, your probes near [body] report that a miniature black hole materialized from empty space and cut through it at relativistic speeds. The planet was reduced to a torus as the projectile consumed the center, and the remains shattered into an asteroid belt as the impact propagated. The planet has been destroyed.
EyeOfEntropyStation|The Eye of Entropy crackles for a few moments before emitting a blast of radiation. Moments later, your probes near [body] report that a miniature black hole materialized from empty space and swallowed it completely. No trace of the station remains.
EyeOfEntropyStar|The Eye of Entropy crackles for several seconds before emitting a colossal blast of radiation. Moments later, your probes near [star] report that a mid-sized black hole materialized from empty space and slammed into the star at relativistic speeds. The resulting explosion reduced all orbiting bodies to dust before scattering them to the void, leaving only the singularity where the system once stood.
