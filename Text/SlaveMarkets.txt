Used Slave Auction
These slaves have been trained to varying degrees by their former masters, but discarded, usually to make room for new stock. Slaves from here have been heavily used, and will run on the older side.

Raider's Union
A boisterous auction by pirates who opportunistically hit small colonies. Slaves from here will be disobedient, and not as scared of you as they were of their former captors. Given the brutality of the raiders, it's safe to assume that none will be virgins, though they are cheap.

Prisoner Auction
A pseudo-governmental affair, the prisoner auction started as a way for small colonies to pay others to host their incarcerated. Over time, capitalism mutated it into its current form. Slaves from here will be mostly-young hardened criminals, and will require significant training.

The Juvie Corporation
Raiders often kidnap slaves that are too young to sell. The Juvie corporation buys them for cheap and keeps them alive until they are. Slaves from the Juvie corporation will mostly be virgins, and will be slightly more obedient than raided slaves due to their confinement.
[AddSlave|Aspiring hero/Lived with her parents/Was college-bound[intelligence|40]/Stir crazy/Doesn't get along with others[charisma|-100]/No life skills[intelligence|-20]/Lesbian/Born male, but was converted by the Juvie Corporation before puberty/Cries every night[addtag|depersonalizer]/Hates men/Great storyteller[charisma|50]/Furry/Impulsive[addtag|overeater]/Patient/Bipolar[addtag|overeater]/Hopeless romantic/Cynical/Selfish/Trusting to a fault[obedience|40]/Talks quietly/Low self-esteem/Gossips whenever she has the opportunity/Believes in a mystical force, and becomes aggressive when questioned[intelligence|-30]/Was bought by the Juvie Corporation as an infant, and has watched countless older friends be sold[addtag|depersonalizer]/Believes that sex is sacred, and hates the idea of being used for pleasure[addtag|hatessex]/Frequently dissociates in unpleasant situations[addtag|depersonalizer]/Will do anything for her friends/Was sexually abused as a child, and briefly mistook the raiders that kidnapped her for vigilantes[addtag|depersonalizer]/Has a beautiful voice, and sings to ease stress[charisma|30]/Had a cat, but was separated when the raiders came/Never left her little sister's side until she was sent off to auction/Had a big sister in the Juvie Corporation's cells, but was separated when she was sold|You bought her from the Juvie Corporation|min/min|0/40|0/20||Virgin][expression|pleading][pose|sad]

Breeders' Show
An everlasting parade run by professional slave breeders. Slaves from here will have been bred for servitude, trained from a young age, and sold as soon as they reached their majority. They are expensive, but they're guaranteed virgins, and completely devoted to their masters.

The Pasture
A market set up to look like an open field. Its sells only slaves that have been modified for permanent lactation. They're guaranteed to be immediately productive in any dairy, but they're completely untrained for sexual services.

Bigger and Better
A niche market that force-feeds its slaves until they reach large sizes. Their specialty nature makes them expensive, though most slavemasters would ignore them completely.

Sunset Farms
The inevitable fate of any slave lucky (or unlucky) enough to reach old age. Most will never be bought, but they are listed at deep discounts, and the price occasionally dips low enough to attract food manufacturers.
[AddSlave|Blank stare/Mildly senile/Rambles for long periods about nothing in particular/Belives that slavery is just/Resigned to her fate/Was subject to many experiments, and no longer remembers much[addtag|mindbroken]/Was enslaved as a child, and has known no other life/Has attempted to escape hundreds of times/Was made ancient in a mishap with a chrono chamber/Veteran/Inbred|You bought her from Sunset Farms.|60/80||][expression|submission][pose|Idle]

Exo Market
Humans are far from alone in the galaxy, and have conquered many species on their road to dominion. Those that are usable are invariably bred and sold to collectors here.
