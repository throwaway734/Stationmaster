Sublevel
[environment|sublevel]Beneath the main floor of your station, there's a network of machinery that keeps it running. From the hydroponic system that provides staple foods, to the CO2 scrubbers that keep everyone breathing, the complexity is staggering. Recently, your maintenance bots have reported signs of life down in the tunnels. It's not uncommon for a station's undesirables to colonize in this way, as it's outside of the security drones' regular patrols. The access shafts are not designed for human habitation though, and the squatters are likely to break something if allowed to remain.
	Order your security drones to massacre the encampment on camera
		Every citizen's main screen instantly switches to the view from your drones as they descend into the depths of the sublevel. They are initially confused, but when the first kill is seen, cheers and whistles begin to echo through the station. Your robotic servants are rarely authorized to use lethal force, and it's fascinating to watch them tear their way through the encampments. By the end, your whole station erupts in applause every time one of the denizens is chased down and torn apart. [backgroundloop|gang][playsound|tornapart]
		Once the maze is cleansed, your maintenance bots get to work clearing the bodies. Your reputation as a brutal overlord has been cemented by this spectacle.[Rep|-10][Influence|10][backgroundloop|base]
	Vent the air from the sublevel
		After ensuring that the sublevel are properly sealed, you simply open them to space. Your scanners show a few people being violently ejected into the void, but most of the work will be done by suffocation. Once an hour has passed, you close the airlocks and re-pressurize the area, leaving your maintenance bots to clear the remaining bodies. The citizens of your station experienced only a soft hissing noise, and were kept completely unaware of both the problem and the solution.[playsound|hiss]
	{extreme}Hunt the denizens for sport
		You decide to have some fun with this. You don your power armor and descend into the sublevel yourself. You tune your scanners to search for life signs, and easily identify the main locations where they're hidden.[backgroundloop|base]
		As you come across the first denizen, you fire a single shot from your plasma rifle, instantly disintegrating most of his unarmored body.[playsound|gun]
		You continue moving through the sublevel, massacring them as you go, until you come to the last survivor, a young woman. [AddSlave|Was Homeless|You personally hunted her down and raped her in the sublevels of your station before enslaving her.|min/20|0/0|60/100][clothe][humansound|begging]
		She backs against the wall, terrified and begging. You set your rifle to stun and fire a round into her chest. She falls, twitching violently, to the floor, her face twisted in a silently agonized expression.[playsound|gun][humansound|coughing][pose|doggyrapeprep]
		You pull her pants off without any resistance, and, by the time she can move again, you've already forced yourself into her. She is still suffering the after-effects of the stun round, and can't catch her breath enough to scream properly, instead retching and sobbing as you have your way with her. [humansound|gasping][strip|legs][pose|doggyrape]
		You take your time, effortlessly maneuvering her into multiple positions among the corpses of her compatriots, before finally finishing inside her. You summon a security drone to take her broken body away for processing.[sex][playsound|drone][humansound|sobbing][pose|droneupsidedown]
	Order your security drones to arrest the denizens, enslaving those who are slave material
		Your security drones descend into the sublevel, efficiently massacring the majority of the helpless creatures, and capturing those who appear to be slave material. When all is said and done, the camp is annihilated, and three of the denizens have been taken into your custody.[playsound|drone][backgroundloop|base][AddSlave|Was Homeless|Your drones captured her from the sublevels beneath the station||0/0|60/100][AddSlave|Led a homeless encampment|Your drones captured her from the sublevels beneath the station||0/0|60/100][AddSlave|Was Homeless|Your drones captured her from the sublevels beneath the station||0/0|60/100][playsound|drone]
	Arrest the homeless people and ship them off your station (Costs $5000)
		You have your security drones round up the homeless and herd them into a converted cargo freighter bound for another station. They're someone else's problem now. Your people see this as an act of cowardice, and your reputation suffers slightly.[Rep|10][Influence|-10][Money|-5000][playsound|drone]
	Give the denizens enough money to live on your station (Costs $100,000)
		You announce to the denizens of the sublevel that they will be given amnesty aboard your station, and a generous stipend until they can manage to earn a decent living. It takes some time, but one by one, they begin to trust you and emerge from their hiding places. The cost of this gesture was significant, but your reputation as a benevolent ruler has been cemented.[Rep|20][Influence|20][Money|-100000]
	{extreme}Sell licenses to hunt the denizens
		Sensing a business opportunity, you announce to your station that there's a limited-time hunting expedition available, and buyers can keep what they catch. A few wealthy citizens sign up, and you turn them loose on the sublevel. They take their time, scouring every corner of the tunnels, and enjoying their newly-captured property as they go. As they finally leave, they all thank you for the memorable experience, and take home their prizes. Your reputation as a ruthless businessman has increased, and you've collected a nice sum in entry fees.[Rep|-50][Influence|25][Money|50000]

Vandal
A tourist has vandalized a shop on your station. While the damage was insignificant, she has no money to pay for fines, and is thus subject to enslavement.[AddSlave|Was a troubled teen|Your drones caught her vandalizing the station|min/19|0/0|60/100][clothe]
	Ban her from the station.
		The vandal protests lightly at the premature end of her vacation, but understands the mercy you have shown her. She leaves on the next ship to her homeworld, never to return. Your citizens see this as an act of mercy, as they know what actions you could have taken.[rep|10][remove]
	{extreme}Rape her, then ban her from the station
		The vandal cries out in fear as you calmly let her know that you will let her leave the station, but you're going to rape her first. The mechanical restraints pull her into the air and spread her legs apart, and she begs you to reconsider as you advance towards her. [humansound|scream][humansound|begging][pose|dronemissionaryprep]
		With a well-practiced efficiency, you cut off her clothing. You're in no particular hurry, so you take some time to roughly grab and twist her most sensitive areas, drawing out scream after scream of pain and humiliation, and preparing her for what comes next.[strip][pose|dronemissionaryprep][humansound|screaming]
		Unfortunately for her, this is only the beginning. You slowly get into position between her legs and force yourself into her struggling, screeching body. You take your time with her, sampling her in several positions as the drone moves her to suit your whims. She eventually stops struggling and moves limply where the drone takes her, her screaming long since reduced to pitiful sobbing.[humansound|painfulsex] 
		When you finally finish, your drone lets her go, and she collapses into a sobbing heap on the floor. You leave her to gather the remains of her clothing and get on the next flight out of your domain. She will never speak of what happened here.[remove][macro|postrape]
	Enslave her
		The vandal begins to hyperventilate as she grasps what is happening to her. Her knuckles turn white as they grip the arms of her chair. She begs you for mercy, having seen the horrors that the slaves endure here, but to no avail. The security drone collars her and directs her to her new quarters for processing.[pose|droneupsidedown][humansound|begging][playsound|drone]

Abolitionist
An abolitionist was caught trying to smuggle one of your slaves off the station in her suitcase. Punishing the slave will be easy; a few days under your direct supervision will convince her never to attempt escape again. This one requires a bit more thought though, as her treatment may impact the frequency of future attempts.[AddSlave|Always hated slavery|You caught her trying to smuggle a slave off the station||0/0|20/50][clothe][pose|boundseated]
	Ban her from the station
		As you enter the holding cell, the abolitionist is shaking in her seat. Her expression shifts from terror to an almost palpable relief as you explain that you're showing mercy, and merely banning her from the station. She quickly gathers her belongings and scurries to the port to leave before you change your mind. This act of mercy inspires awe in your more romantic residents, but does little to discourage future attempts.[rep|10][inf|-10][remove]
	Enslave her, and show her what she's missing.
		As you enter the holding cell, the abolitionist looks up in terror, which deepens as you calmly explain that the punishment for sedition is enslavement. She lunges desperately for the door, but the security drone harshly pulls her back to her seated position. You gently run your hand over her breast and down to her thigh before she is collared and dragged, kicking and screaming, to her new room for processing. With such a severe consequence established, future abolitionists may visit other stations instead.[inf|10][pose|droneupsidedown][humansound|screaming]
	{extreme}Give her to your citizens (this will likely kill her)
		You decide to let the citizens show her what they think of abolitionists. You cuff her limbs and drag her out into the public plaza. The station's computer amplifies your voice as you explain the nature of her crimes before tossing her to the gathering crowd. She's immediately pulled under the group of citizens, and you hear screams and tearing as you walk away. [strip][pose|cowering][humansound|screaming][playsound|tearing][backgroundloop|gang]
		A few hours later, the station computer notifies you that the abolitionist succumbed to the relentless assault, and her body has been thrown out the airlock. This moment will stick in the minds of your potential enemies for years to come.[inf|50][rep|-20][hide][remove][backgroundloop|suite]
	Space her
		You have a security drone restrain her and drag her to an airlock. You meet them there, and explain her sentence in front of a gathering crowd. She tries to escape the machine's grasp, but to no avail. The robot drags her through the inner door before unceremoniously throwing her against the wall and leaving, closing the door behind it. The outer door opens almost immediately, and she is yanked into the hard vacuum, never to return.[inf|30][hide][remove][playsound|hiss][humansound|scream]

{extreme}Fallout
An opportunity has presented itself. A moon within your sphere of influence has been almost totally destroyed by nuclear weapons. It's not worth occupying, but scans show survivors on the surface.
	Send a ship to rescue the survivors (Costs $5000)
		Drone footage from the ship shows that the people of the moon were initially suspicious, but, when they realized that the ship was there to help, eagerly climbed aboard. Your ship takes them to a nearby inhabited world with a good reputation, and they all thank the camera profusely as they disembark.[Rep|50][Inf|20][money|-5000]
	Go to the planet yourself and capture as many survivors as possible.
		[environment|wasteland]You land your ship near the largest concentration of life signs. Using your ship's sensors, you quickly find the main camp within the city.
		Under cover of darkness, and with the help of your security drones, you sneak around the outside of the camp, knocking out the guards one by one as you work your way around the perimeter. One in particular catches your eye, and your drones report that there are four hours left before the watch changes, so you decide to have some fun. You let your drones handle the rest of the guards as you gag your new toy.[AddSlave|Eats Little|You captured her from a post-apocalyptic camp|min/min|0/0|0/40||N||lightbuild][pose|sleeping][clothe][humansound|idle]
		You peel her grimy clothing off of her, revealing a fit (though slightly emaciated) body. You knocked her out with a carefully-placed blow to the head, but she will be awake soon. You quickly bind and gag her with her ruined clothing before she regains consciousness.[strip]
		She wakes up as you force yourself into her, and immediately begins to struggle against the bonds, but can make no progress against the knotted rags. You take your time with her, and put a screen in her view so she can watch from the drones' perspective as they silently massacre her fellow guards.[pose|doggyrape][humansound|screaming]
		You eventually finish in her, and summon a drone to cart her sobbing body back to your ship before you head towards the camp.[hide][humansound|sobbing]
		The settlers don't yet know, but they are completely unguarded when you and your drones storm the camp from all directions. The disheveled mass panics and fires wildly, but only manages to graze the drones, and their primitive weapons are insufficient to do any real damage. They are quickly overrun by your forces, and, though many were killed in the chaos, your drones manage to line up an impressive array of survivors. You go down the line, unceremoniously executing the ones that aren't worth your time, before having the drones round up the rest and drag them onto your ship.[playsound|drone][playsound|gun][AddSlave|Prefers Rat to normal food|You captured her from a post-apocalyptic camp||0/0|0/40][AddSlave|Hates Space|You captured her from a post-apocalyptic camp||0/0|0/40][Rep|-40][Inf|20][clothe]
	Go to the planet yourself and find a lone survivor to hunt
		Life signs on this world are scattered, so you land near a resourceful-looking young woman. You leave your drones with the ship, preferring a more sporting hunt this time. You spend some time following her from a distance, observing her scavenging routes.[AddSlave|Lone Wolf|You hunted her through a post-apocalyptic wasteland|min/22|40/60|50/80||nonvirgin][clothe][environment|wasteland]
		Once you are content that you understand her routine, you lay your trap. She is systematically working her way through the town, and it's obvious which building she will be scavenging next. You sit in the bedroom of the ruined suburban house and wait.[hide]
		She arrives exactly when you expected her to. You listen as she slowly makes her way through the house, stuffing canned goods and dry food into her backpack, before she finally opens the door to the bedroom.[show]
		She sees you immediately, and freezes in shock for a fraction of a second, but that was all you needed. You lunge at her and easily take her to the ground with your augmented strength. You slam her head against the floor of the building to soften her resistance before you grab her by the hair and drag her to the bed.[pose|doggyprep][humansound|coughing]
		She begins to struggle as soon as she regains her senses, but it's too late. You pin her to the bed with one hand around the back of her neck, while using the other to grab her waistband and pull down her pants. She has abandoned all hope of stealth, and is now screaming, begging for somebody to help her, but there is nobody else within miles of your position.[strip|legs][humansound|screaming]
		You straddle her as she desperately struggles, and you ram yourself into her without preamble. She kicks and screeches, but is helpless against your brutal assault. You get the sense that this isn't the first time that she's been raped in this hellscape, so you make sure to make this one memorable, beating her relentlessly and switching between her holes at a whim. You continue the rape for hours, until her screams have turned to quiet sobbing, and she has all but lost-consciousness.[humansound|painfulsex][pose|doggyrape]
		When you are content that she is properly broken, you collar her and summon your ship to take you both back to your station. She can't summon the energy to struggle as you drag her out into the street, and simply stares into space as you strap her into the restraints.[rep|-20][humansound|idle]
	Take no action.
		It appears that the fate of this moon has escaped the notice of other local powers, and their ultimate fate is all but certain. Some worlds must be allowed to die.

Novice Pilot
A novice pilot accidentally crossed into the restricted space around your station. The automated station security apprehended her (and her expensive ship) immediately, and she's awaiting your judgment at the security office.[AddSlave|Vapid|You framed her for smuggling after she flew too close to your station|min/min|60/60|70/100][clothe][humansound|idle]
	Let her off with a warning, and dismiss the event as automated security being overzealous.
		The girl looks terrified as you enter the room, but relief washes over her face as you tell her you're letting her off with a warning. She thanks you graciously for understanding, and scurries into her ship to fly home. Your reputation as a benevolent leader has improved.[rep|20][remove]
	Charge her with petty trespassing, and fine her accordingly.
		The girl looks down as you enter, obviously ashamed of her position. You explain that she was trespassing on your region of space, and that she will be fined accordingly. As soon as the money from her family comes in, you allow her to leave, and she sheepishly flies home.[money|5000][remove]
	Charge her with endangerment of the station, and take her ship.
		The girl looks down as you enter, obviously ashamed of her position. You explain that she was far away from her established flight path, and she could easily have crashed with another ship. You're therefore charging her with endangering the station, and her ship is forfeit. She protests, but knows that she's not in a position to argue. She slinks from the cell and calls her family to book her transport home. You manage to sell her ship for a significant sum.[rep|-10][money|100000][remove]
	Plant contraband on her ship, then charge her with smuggling and enslave her.
		You use your black market contacts to procure some illegal weapons, and have a security drone plant them on her ship while she's being held. As you read the charges to her, her look transitions from terror, to confusion, then disbelief as she realizes what you've done. When you tell her that the punishment for smuggling is enslavement, she tries to jump up with a shriek, but the bindings at her wrists and ankles pull her roughly back into a seated position. A drone comes in to collar her and take her away, sobbing, for processing. Those that knew her spread rumors that you planted the evidence, which slightly damages your reputation, but they don't have enough proof to cause a full incident.[rep|-20][humansound|scream][playsound|drone][humansound|sobbing]

Stowaway
Your security team apprehended a stowaway attempting to cross onto your station. There's no record of her DNA in the central database, and she was likely a street urchin somewhere. She appears almost feral, but doesn't speak as you enter the room, though she's obviously terrified.[AddSlave|Quiet|She was a stowaway on a ship bound for your station.|min/18|60/60|70/100][clothe][humansound|fear][pose|boundseated]
	Grant her residence aboard your station
		The girl is unsure of how to react to this kindness. She stammers out thanks, and slowly backs out of the room. She obviously doesn't know how to live in polite society, and it's only a matter of time before she commits another crime worthy of enslavement. Still, she will likely enjoy her few days of freedom, and hopefully use it to book passage to a more forgiving station.[rep|20][remove]
	Enslave her
		The girl seems to understand, though she says nothing. She is clearly terrified, but it's dampened by the fact that she anticipated this possibility. She doesn't resist as your drone collars her and takes her away for processing.[playsound|drone]
	Space her
		These street urchins are nothing but trouble, and it's not worth your time to teach her how to be a good slave. You have your security drone drag her out of the room. She remains quiet, and likely thinks that she is being enslaved until the drone approaches the airlock. She begins to scream, but there is nobody around to hear her, and the drone has no trouble throwing her into the gate.[pose|dronemissionaryprep][humansound|screaming]
		You watch as she is vented into space with the rest of your station's garbage, an expression of terror frozen on her face. If she were a less worthless person, this may have reflected badly on you. In her case though, nobody who matters will care.[remove][playsound|hiss][hide]

Hot Coffee
As you sit in a coffee shop, a young woman catches your eye from across the room. She appears to be working hard on something, and is typing away on a primitive keyboard. She's gorgeous (in a nerdy and slightly awkward way), but looks anxious. You have your station's computer run a check, and it confirms your suspicions. She has a large amount of debt with several creditors, and, were someone to acquire it all, they would be eligible to enslave her.[AddSlave|Terrible with Money|She accumulated enough debt to qualify for enslavement, and you bought it.|20/25|30/60|70/100][clothe][pose|boundseated][backgroundloop|cafe]
	Buy the debt and enslave her (Costs $10,000)
		You direct your station's computer to buy all of her various debts and arrest her. Before you've finished your coffee, you see a drone approach her and begin the process of arresting her. Your drones have a reputation, and you see a look of panic on her face as it escorts her out, but it's unlikely that she understands the extent of her plight just yet.[money|-10000][playsound|drone]
	{extreme}Trick her into going on a date, and enslave her after (Costs $10,000)
		You walk over to her and strike up a conversation. She immediately knows who you are, of course, and is slightly starstruck by your presence. As you ask her to dinner, she begins to hyperventilate slightly, but maintains her composure and hastily accepts.[expression|surprise]
		You meet her later in the evening at one of the most expensive restaurants on your station. As she enters, you subtly pull the tag off of her cocktail dress. She is flustered, and it is painfully obvious that she has no idea how to act on a date, let alone in such an upper-class environment.[backgroundloop|restaurant]
		You spend some time making small talk and flirting, but once she has had a few drinks, she begins to drone extensively about something she's working on. This would be an annoying turn, but she is oblivious as you completely ignore her, and instead enjoy the delicious food. You beckon her to follow when you get up to leave, and she does so hesitantly, her meal still half-finished on the table.
		As you arrive at her door, she kisses you goodnight and thanks you for the date. As she begins to enter her apartment, you roughly shove her from behind and enter after her, closing the door behind you. She turns back to you, a look of fear and confusion crossing her face. You explain that you have bought her various debts, and that the night isn't over until you say it is.[humansound|gasp][backgroundloop|suite][humansound|fear]
		It takes her a moment to comprehend what you said, but once she does, she immediately begins to scream and struggle against your hold. Unfortunately for her, you are much stronger, and easily force her down onto her bed. [humansound|screaming][pose|missionaryrapeprep]
		You pin her arms over her head as you slide up her dress, savoring the feeling of her squirming beneath you. Her struggles gain renewed vigor as you delicately pull off her panties, but she is pathetically weak compared to you, and can only tense alluringly as your hands trace their way across her naked body.[humansound|crying][strip]
		You pry open her legs, and she screams in pain as you force yourself into her. You feel the telltale resistance of a hymen tearing at the assault, and marvel at how long her personality has managed to preserve her virginity. She screws her eyes shut and turns away, trying not to look at you as you rape her in her own bed, but she cries out in pain with every thrust. You take your time, enjoying her in several positions across her meager quarters until she is reduced to a broken wreck.[humansound|painfulsex]
		You finally finish inside her, but she is on the brink of losing consciousness, and only reacts by tensing slightly. You pull out of her, and she collapses to the bed, weeping. After cleaning up, you are struck by a small curiosity. You have your station unlock her computer, and you see that she was attempting to write a novel. She recognizes it immediately as you read the first line out loud, and looks over just in time to watch you throw her machine into the incinerator. If she had the strength left to scream, she might have done so, but she simply buries her face in the pillow.[macro|postrape]
		You have a security drone take her away for processing. The assault left her far too weak to fight, and she hangs limply from its tentacles as it drags her to her new home.[pose|dronehanging][humansound|idle][playsound|drone][sex][money|-10000]
	Take no action
		One of her creditors will likely connect the dots and enslave her eventually, but you let her live another day as a free woman.[remove]

Journalist
A notorious journalist has been caught sneaking around your station. She's previously made a name for herself by exposing the embarrassing secrets of politicians, and she's now turned her attention to you. Fortunately, your systems are constantly watching, and she was apprehended attempting to hack her way into a secure area. Your station awaits your decision.[AddSlave|Inquisitive|She was a journalist, but you ended her career when you caught her trespassing and enslaved her.|22/25|0/20|20/40][clothe][pose|boundseated][humansound|fear]
	Cooperate with her, but only if she targets someone else
		As you walk into the room, she immediately launches into a speech about the truth, but you silence her with a gesture. You explain to her that you mean her no harm, and that you actually believe in her mission (leaving out that you only support it when it's directed at your rivals). You offer to use your influence to help her, with the small caveat that she has to investigate someone else. She bristles at this initially, but knows that the cooperation of a man with your reputation would be a tremendous boon. She accepts, and leaves the station to work on a less-terrifying leader.[remove][humansound|fear]
	Ban her from the station
		As you walk into the room, the journalist immediately launches into a speech about the truth, but you silence her with a harsh electric shock through her restraints. You explain to her that she is banned from the station, and will be summarily enslaved if she ever returns. She opens her mouth to protest, but, seeing you preparing to deliver another shock, relents. You personally ensure that she boards a ship, never to return. Your reputation suffers slightly, as people wonder what secrets you have that are worth hiding.[rep|-20][inf|10][remove][playsound|shock][humansound|scream][humansound|fear]
	Enslave her
		As you walk into the holding cell, the journalist immediately launches into a speech about the truth, but you silence her with a powerful electric shock, leaving her convulsing softly in her chair. You explain to her that the penalty for attempting access to a restricted section is enslavement. As she begins to comprehend her situation, she starts to struggle against the bonds once again, but you cease her efforts with another electric shock. A security drone collars her and drags her, kicking and screaming, away for processing. Your reputation suffers, as people wonder what she was investigating.[rep|-40][inf|20][playsound|shock][humansound|screaming][playsound|drone]
	Space her
		After ensuring that there will be nobody in the path between her cell and the airlock, you simply have a security drone space her. You arrange to be present to wave goodbye as she gracelessly expires in the hard vacuum. She won't be bothering anyone anymore. You later see a news story about her disappearance, but she's angered so many powerful people that it will be impossible to tell who finally ended her life.[remove][hide][playsound|hiss]

Pickpocket
As you walk down the street, you feel a bump at your side, and see an apparently-homeless woman sprint away with your credit chip. You shake your head in bemusement as a security drone appears from above and roughly hoists her aloft. As it does so, she screams incoherently about the people who are out to get her, and it is apparent that she is having some sort of psychotic break. That makes sense. Nobody sane would have dared to commit such an obvious crime on your station, least of all against you. The security drone, still holding the emaciated prisoner, returns your wallet to your pocket. The question of what to do with the sputtering creature falls to you.[AddSlave|Mentally Unstable|She attempted to pickpocket you during an apparent psychotic break, and you enslaved her as punishment.|min/20|0/0|40/60|||Insane][clothe][humansound|screaming]
	Enslave her
		You simply have the drone drag her away for processing as she screams obscenities after you. Though she's obviously mentally ill, she may yet be useful to someone.
	Space her
		You have your drone unceremoniously throw her screaming body out of the airlock. If it had been a more prominent citizen, this harsh punishment may have reflected badly on you. In her case though, nobody important will notice or care about her disappearance.[remove][humansound|none][playsound|hiss][hide]
	Ban her from the station
		You have your drone escort her off the station. This is obviously not the place for her kind. She sputters and shouts obscenities directed at you, property owners, cloud people, and simply "Them," but cannot escape the machine's grasp. She's someone else's problem now.[remove]

Preacher
As you are taking a walk through a shopping district, you come across a woman standing on a crate and making a passionate (though somewhat trite) speech about the evils of slavery, the station, and your leadership in particular. The crowd surrounding her suggests that she has been at this for some time, and has gathered a following. Her simple clothes make her look poor at first glance, but she is clearly more intelligent than the rabble aboard the station. Such a figure could become dangerous if left unchecked.[AddSlave|Articulate|She was an aspiring prophet against the evils of your station. You enslaved her for sedition.|20/25|35/35|0/0][clothe]
	Ban her from the station
		You take the simple approach, and simply ban her from the station. Your influence suffers as the people think that you were afraid of her message. On the plus side, she won't bother you anymore, and her followers have left with her.[inf|-50][rep|-50][remove][hide]
	Make her disappear
		You locate her quarters, and have a security drone silently kill her in her sleep before dumping her body out of an airlock. After her disappearance, the people of your station are certain of your involvement, and she becomes a martyr figure for her followers. On the plus side, the leaderless movement is doomed to infighting, and the show of strength discourages future sedition.[inf|20][rep|-80][remove][hide]
	Enslave her
		You simply have your drones cart her off for enslavement, citing the crime of sedition. This inelegant response enrages her followers, and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the station. Still, you were legally in the right, and you got a decent toy out of the process.[inf|-100][rep|-100][humansound|screaming][pose|dronestruggle][backgroundloop|angrycrowd]
	Discredit her followers and enslave her (Costs $10,000)
		You hire experienced agents to infiltrate her organization, and direct the focus away from the core message of abolitionism, focusing it instead on the worship of a particular deity. Many of her followers abandon the organization at this change, and it's a simple matter for your agents to split the remaining devotees on arbitrary lines, evaporating the movement completely.[hide]
		Now that she's essentially been forgotten by her cult, there's no significant backlash when you arrest and enslave her for sedition, and she has been so depressed by the disintegration of her movement that she does not struggle when the drone arrests her. The more intelligent among your people recognize your fingerprints in the matter, and respect your elegant handling of the situation. [inf|50][humansound|fear][show][pose|dronehanging]
	{extreme}Bribe some locals to take care of her (Costs $5,000)
		You send an anonymous message to some disreputable locals, and they descend on the organization, beating the followers into submission before brutally raping and murdering their leader. Their leader relays you video proof, and you immediately reply with payment in full. You've successfully disguised this as a raid by a local gang, and there will be no significant impact on your reputation.[money|-5000][strip][pose|facedownonground][humansound|none][remove]

		You contact the aspiring prophetess and explain that you're willing to offer a sum of money for her to change her message. You get no response, but the station's computer forwards you a video of her showing your request to her followers. They're jeering at your cowardly attempt to be rid of them, and feel emboldened now that they have prompted it. With this, they will likely become a thorn in your side for years to come.[inf|-100][rep|-50][remove]

Prostitute
Your systems inform you of a woman who was working as an unlicensed prostitute out of her quarters. She was extremely careful, and miraculously escaped detection for some time before she was apprehended. It would appear that she attracted a few wealthy clients who had moral qualms with slavery, and she was able to make a small fortune aboard your station (though her lifestyle suggests that she doesn't have the cash on hand to cover the debt).[AddSlave|Cunning|She was an unlicensed prostitute aboard your station. You enslaved her to cover her unpaid taxes and fees.|min/25|35/35|0/0||nonvirgin][clothe][pose|boundseated][humansound|fear]
	Enslave her
		The law is clear on this. You tell her that you will take her body to cover her debts. She struggles halfheartedly against the bonds, but has lived aboard your station long enough to know that it's pointless. She sobs quietly as a drone drags her to her new quarters. Her patrons among your citizenry will take issue with this action, but they know enough to keep quiet about it, lest they be implicated as well.[inf|-10][humansound|sobbing][playsound|drone][pose|dronehanging]
	Allow her to continue, but demand back taxes and licensing fees
		The prostitute begrudgingly agrees to your terms. Over the next months, she manages to pay back her debt to you (with interest). Her patrons are grateful at your lenience in this matter.[inf|10][rep|5][money|10000][remove]
	Ban her from the station
		You tell her that she is to be banned from your station. She begs you to reconsider, citing her significant client base, but must know that this could have gone much worse. She boards the next flight out, never to return. Some of your citizens think that this was a pointless exercise, but others respect your dedication to impartially enforcing the law.[rep|10][remove][humansound|begging]

Orphan Ready
Virtually all slaveholding stations operate an orphanage, and yours is no exception. Raising a child costs money, and debt incurred from living expenses more than meets the threshold for enslavement. As an added bonus, girls who are trained for slavery from childhood are extremely obedient once they reach adulthood, and often accept slavery as a natural part of life. Today, one of your orphans has reached her age of majority, and she is waiting for you in her room.[AddSlave|Timid|She was an orphan who grew up in slave training.|min/min|50/100|0/0||Virgin][clothe][humansound|idle]
	Enslave her
		The girl nods and silently follows the security drone to her new room. She has been prepared for this day for her entire life, and will eagerly serve you.[pose|idle]
	Forgive her debts and let her go.
		The girl's face is contorted in a look of shock. Her lifetime of slave training has made her quiet, and not remotely prepared her for the world outside. She stammers out a quick thanks, before slowly leaving to explore the station as a free woman. Without any knowledge of how to operate in society, she will likely end up as someone's slave soon, and your citizens do not see this as an act of kindness.[remove]

{extreme}Door to Door
A citizen is going door to door selling candy to raise money for some charitable organization or another. Ordinarily, you would have simply ignored her, but she rang your doorbell several times, and is rudely yelling at you to open up through your door.[addslave][clothe][humansound|idle][playsound|doorbell]
	Buy some candy (Costs $100)
		You push past your irritation and buy a large amount (admittedly delicious) candy from her. She thanks you and moves along to the next door. Word about your generous purchase becomes a minor human-interest story, and your reputation improves slightly. [rep|5][remove][playsound|payment]
	Trick her into coming inside and rape her
		You invite her in as you feign a search for your credit chip, but as soon as she enters, the door closes behind her. She quickly turns around at the sound and tries to open it, but finds that she can't. You grab her by the back of the neck and shove her to the ground.[humansound|gasp][humansound|fear][playsound|doorclose][pose|doggyprep]

		She does not resist you as you rape her, and you finish in her quickly.You allow her to move once again, and she stays frozen for a moment before she regains her motor functions. She pulls her pants back up and walks out the door in a daze. She may be a citizen, but she will never tell anyone about this; nobody would believe her if she did. The security footage will show you politely declining the sale.[clothe][remove][pose|idle]
	Ignore her
		You have better things to do than respond. Eventually, the knocking stops.[remove]

Refugee
A ship has exited hyperspace dangerously close to your station, and immediately began to broadcast a distress signal, demanding access to a docking bay. You had plenty of capacity, so there was no harm in allowing it to land. As she boards, she immediately begins speaking to a camera, knowing that her presence is unusual enough to attract your attention. She explains that her homeworld is going through an ethnic cleansing, and that she's a refugee. Several inmates of a camp helped her steal a ship so that she could leave the planet and get help.[AddSlave|Talented thief|She was a refugee who daringly escaped a death camp. You enslaved her to cover her docking fees aboard your station.|25/30|0/0|0/0|||Depersonalizer][clothe][humansound|fear]
	Enslave her to cover her docking fees
		You make sure the station charges her the maximum possible last-minute docking fees, and, before she is even finished speaking, the fees amounted to more than the cost of her tiny ship, making her subject to enslavement to cover her debts. As you explain this to her, she shakes with rage and begins to scream obscenities, but a security drone is already on its way to fetch her.[humansound|screaming]
	Enslave her and take advantage of the chaos on the planet
		You make sure the station charges her the maximum possible last-minute docking fees, and, before she is even finished speaking, the fees amounted to more than the cost of her tiny ship. As the security drone takes her screaming body away for processing, you find the planet that she came from.[humansound|screaming]
		It is definitely going through chaos, and the telltale signs of genocide are apparent. You send a message to the perpetrating government, offering to buy the contents of their camps. They gladly accept, and, a couple messages later, you have lined up buyers and dispatched haulers to complete delivery. Your reputation as a ruthless businessman has increased, you made a substantial amount of money, and you managed to divert a few souvenirs to your station.[humansound|none][money|400000][rep|-50][inf|50][AddSlave|Traumatized by genocide|You bought her as part of a bulk order from a genocidal government.|min/25|0/0|20/50] [AddSlave|Traumatized by genocide|You bought her as part of a bulk order from a genocidal government.|min/25|0/0|20/50|||Depersonalizer] [AddSlave|Traumatized by genocide|You bought her as part of a bulk order from a genocidal government.|min/25|0/0|20/50|||Depersonalizer] 
	Fund her efforts (Costs $500,000)
		You agree to help her stop the genocide. The planet is poor, and it is simple enough to hire some mercenaries to assassinate the instigators and maintain sanctuaries against the government. The woman is eternally grateful for your efforts. Your deed is immortalized in a thrilling movie (though your sacrifices are played up for drama's sake), and your reputation and influence have increased massively.[rep|400][inf|200][remove][humansound|idle] 
	Ignore her

War Tourist
Your station has detected an uncontacted human colony. It appears to be going through its first-stage industrial revolution, and is having a civil war. The technology involved is so primitive that you could have a significant impact on the outcome, or you could simply take advantage of the chaos and snap up some displaced refugees.[backgroundloop|suite]
	{extreme}Take a side in exchange for a princess
		After some preliminary research, you find that one of the sides is governed by a royal family, and that the eldest daughter of the family is a beautiful young woman. You send a message to the entire planet, saying that, if the princess is delivered to a specific place the next day, you will annihilate the other side's armies. As a show of force, you drop a small antimatter bomb in an uninhabited area, unleashing devastation beyond anything their world had seen.[AddSlave|Was the princess of a warring country|Her government kidnapped her and turned her over to you in exchange for help in the war effort.|min/20|0/0|100/100||Virgin|Leader][clothe]
		When the time arrives, you land your ship at the appointed place, and several elaborately-dressed military commanders are waiting for you in their cars. You decided on a place that was hard to get to in order to avoid the possibility of a trap, and it's apparent that they rushed to make it on time. One of them opens the back door, revealing the struggling princess. He firmly pulls her out of the car by her hand. She is dressed in what appear to be her normal clothes, and it's obvious by her squirming and sobbing that she did not sacrifice herself willingly. You see the king and queen off to the side, being lightly held back as they sob. The military commander somberly drags the struggling girl to you, and pushes her into your arms.[pose|keepback][humansound|sobbing][playsound|land][environment|wilderness]
			Rape her in front of them
				You take the leash in your hand, and roughly pull the princess towards you. She continues to struggle against you, but you ignore her efforts. They watch with increasing discomfort as you begin to run your hands along her body, and collectively gasp when you suddenly lift her shirt and start to fondle her breasts.[strip|chest]
				You slide your hand down her stomach and into her panties, gently massaging her as she begins to cry openly. Her mother and father, realizing what is going to happen, hide their faces in each others' arms, but are too terrified of your apparent power to intervene.[humansound|crying]
				You slide her pants down and push her to the ground while the military men continue to uncomfortably stand at attention.[strip][pose|missionaryprep]
				Taking a princess' virginity is a rare treat, and you savor the feeling of her tearing hymen as you enter her, drawing out a scream of pain. She moans helplessly as you rape her on the ground, ensuring that her first time is as traumatizing as it is memorable.[humansound|screaming]
				You take your time with her, and she's reduced to a sobbing mess before long. Her tears ruin her elegant makeup, streaking it across her face, and you see blood pooling in dozens on small cuts from being forced against the rough ground. You finally finish inside her, and you feel her muscles relax slightly when you pull out of her.[humansound|sobbing] 
				You then take her by the collar and drag her back to your ship, as the generals behind salute you nervously, trying not to look at the blood and cum dripping from between their princess' legs.

She finds the energy to scream once again as she watches her country and everything she has known destroyed in an instant. Once the blast has cleared and she can clearly see the thick sheet of glass that was once her homeland, you set a course for your station, the princess sobbing bitterly in your back seat.[obedience|20][playsound|explosion][humansound|scream][humansound|crying][backgroundloop|ship]

	Raid a refugee camp

Your ship is advanced enough not to show on their systems, so they learn of your arrival when their anti-aircraft platforms simultaneously melt under your ship's point defense lasers.[playsound|laser][environment|wasteland]

{extreme}Safari
Your station has detected human life on an uncharted planet. The population has very little grasp of technology, and appears to consist of hunter-gatherer tribes scattered across the surface. It likely hasn't seen interference from the interstellar community in the planet's living memory, though that doesn't reach further back than a paltry sixty years.
	Travel there and pick up a trophy
		You travel to the planet and spend some time watching them from orbit. Strikingly, they appear to have done fairly well for themselves despite the lack of technology, and they, on average, seem happier than the people of your station. You quickly develop a favorite, a young woman who leaves her mud hut every morning to pick berries in the nearby wilderness. She appears to be a pillar of the community, but does not seem to have a lover, and is likely a virgin. [AddSlave|Gatherer from a primitive planet|You raped her and kidnapped her from her world.|min/25|0/0|20/50||Non-virgin|primitive][clothe][environment|wilderness]
		You silently set your ship down near her route during the night, and wait for her to pass by. She sees your ship as she approaches, and walks towards it to investigate. As she does, you emerge and she immediately kneels, apparently mistaking you for a deity. You efficiently dispel the notion by kicking her in the gut. She rolls over in pain, clutching her stomach and lying on her side.[pose|facedownonground][humansound|coughing][humansound|punch]
		You unceremoniously pull down her pants as she lies incapacitated on the ground. The shock wears off eventually, but by then it's too late. You pin her down with a hand to the back of her neck, and ram yourself into her from behind.[pose|doggyrape][humansound|scream][humansound|painfulsex][strip|legs]
		She screams in pain as you take her virginity, but you made sure to put your ship out of earshot of the town, and there is nobody around to hear her. It's not often that you spend time in nature, and you savor it, violating her for hours as she slowly transitions from attempts at escape, to defiant screaming, to weak sobbing. [humansound|scream][humansound|painfulsex]
		When you finally finish in her, you feel her tense up slightly at the unfamiliar sensation. She doesn't move after you get up, and sobs bitterly drag her into your ship.[macro|postrape]
	Travel there and play god
		You land in the center of the most populated city, applying extra energy to the thrusters to make a tremendous sound as you do so. You confidently open the door to your ship, and the gathering crowd kneels before you.[backgroundloop|rural]
		You demand that they throw a celebration in your honor, and that they will provide food, drink, and women enough to satisfy your needs until you decide to leave. Some of the tribeswomen look uncomfortable at this, but they know better than to argue with a god, and continue to kneel.[backgroundloop|rural]
		You walk down the ramp of your ship and lightly touch the head of an attractive girl with a small wreath in her hair. She lifts her head to meet your eyes and gasps audibly, but says nothing.[AddSlave|Daughter of a tribal chief|You demanded her as a tribute when you visited as a god.|min/19|100/100|20/60|||primitive][clothe][humansound|gasp][humansound|fear]
		A man with an elaborate headdress, likely the tribe's leader, directs you to a large hut that looks like a place of worship. He grabs the woman's arm and pulls her up, directing her there as well. Based on the gentleness with which the rough man treated her, you suspect she's his daughter. Before you enter, you select a few more of the tribeswomen, and take them all into the building. They appear apprehensive, but are willing to serve their god in any way they can.
		You order the women to strip, and most of them do so without hesitation. The chief's daughter, however, does not, instead sitting silently and staring off into space. You now notice that she, obviously the youngest, appears much more scared than the rest. 
		You repeat your order, and two of the other women, sensing her unwillingness to comply, walk over and carefully remove her clothes as she begins to cry.[strip][humansound|crying]
		She's drawn your attention now, and you decide to have her first. You walk up to her and order her to lie on her back. Her sobs deepen, but she doesn't move, so the same two others grasp her limbs and drag her to the ground, pinning her.[pose|missionaryrapeprep]
		She's crying loudly now, but there's nothing she can do as you climb on top of her and force yourself into her. She screams in pain, and you feel the distinctive sensation of a tearing hymen. You continue with her for a long time, and finally feel her orgasm around you with a pained moan.[pose|missionaryrape][humansound|painfulsex]
		Over the next hours, you take them all in turns, and you eventually finish in one of the anonymous girls, drawing a sigh of relief as she feels you cum inside her.
		As you emerge from the tent, you see that the tribe has indeed prepared a feast for you, and you decide to try the local food, motioning for the still-sobbing chief's daughter to sit by your side as you eat. The cuisine is nothing compared to what's available on your station, of course, but it's passable, and some of spices are new even to your ancient palate. Still, the highlight of the party is the chief's daughter, who you grope at your whim for the duration of the meal.[humansound|fear][clothe][backgroundloop|tribalparty][pose|boundseated]
		As the feast ends, you announce that you will be keeping the chief's daughter with you when you leave, as a fitting sacrifice to the gods. The man stiffens at this, but thanks you for your generosity through gritted teeth as she begins to cry uncontrollably. You take the girl by the hand and gently lead her sobbing form onto your ship before taking off, never to return. [playsound|takeoff][show][humansound|sobbing][backgroundloop|ship]
	Give them access to the knowledge they lost
		You have your on-station manufacturing create a series of obelisks, each with a set of important information for re-establishing technology. You fly over with your ship and drop them at strategic locations around the world. Only time will tell if it works, and if access to high technology would even better their lifestyle, but playing the part of a benevolent god is rewarding in its own way.
	Take no action
		You leave them be. They're not worth your time.

Ex-Lover
You were not always a slaveholder. There was a time when you had to convince women into bed with you using charm instead of simply buying them. Your station alerts you that one such old flame has gone on sale. Apparently, she had fallen into debt, and was put on sale shortly afterwards. She is not the youngest or prettiest woman you've seen, but she has some sentimental value.[AddSlave|You dated her back when you had to date|You bought her from a distant slave market.|35/45|16/46|0/0||nonvirgin][clothe]

Mysterious Arrivals
A pair of arrivals to your station were found to have forged their travel documents. The forgeries were nearly perfect, and they would likely have passed muster at most stations. When you arrive to interrogate them, they immediately claim that they were the queen and princess of a nearby planet, but were forced to flee because of a revolution. A cursory news search confirms their identities, and it would appear that they managed to bring a substantial amount of wealth with them.[AddSlave|Entitled|She was a princess, but war displaced her.

	Enslave them both.
		You explain to them that the penalty for forgery of official entry documents is enslavement. They both begin to scream abuses at you, but their rage turns to agony as you send a painful current coursing through their restraints. The royal life has made them unaccustomed to obedience, but they will learn soon enough. [AddSlave|Regal|She was a queen, but war displaced her.

Girl's School
A neighborhood planet is going through a civil war, and the fighting has reached apocalyptic levels. Through the many radiation spikes, your sensors pick up a powerful distress signal from a girls' college with what appears to be an advanced prototype transmitter. It would appear that several students and faculty have decided to take their chances with the interstellar community rather than face inevitable death in their bomb shelter. Your scanners see several ships from various planets and stations moving in to collect them, but you're the closest, and will be able to get there first.
	Rescue them (will cost $10,000)
		You send a ship to rescue the students. You watch through a screen in your office as it weaves its way though the flack fire on the surface, lands on the bomb shelter, and collects the students before flying away. You have the ship deliver them to the nearest stable world. They all thank the camera profusely, secure in the knowledge that this was the best they could possibly have hoped for.[rep|60][inf|20][money|-10000]

		Immediately after it takes off, the students try to determine who sent the unmarked vessel, and manage to work out the rough course based on the motion of the stars. They know your station by reputation, and spend their voyage sobbing and desperately trying to redirect your ship to another destination. To their collective dismay, they are locked out of the controls, and can only watch as it carries them to their new home.[playsound|takeoff][backgroundloop|ship][humansound|sobbing][environment|ship]

		You take a small fighter down to the surface of the planet, and land a short distance away from their shelter. The planet is obviously in bad shape, but the explosions seem to have subsided in the immediate area, and your scanners show that the next nearest ship is almost a day away.[environment|wasteland][playsound|land]
		You easily found the shelter indicated by the coordinates in the distress signal, but it's locked. Your rifle makes short work of it though, and you easily enter the building. As you enter, you see that there doesn't appear to be anyone in the bunker. They must have been smart enough to recognize a vessel that only holds two passengers.[playsound|laser]
		You begin to carefully search the room, but, before you get far, you hear a muffled sneeze from a closet in the corner. You train your rifle on the door, and loudly demand that the students leave their hiding place.[playsound|sneeze]
		One by one, they emerge, shaking and crying with fear. Keeping your gun trained on them, you explain the rules of the game. Whichever of them manages to make you cum gets to come aboard. The rest of them will die in this room. [humansound|sobbing]
		The oldest of them, likely the teacher, begins to scream and charge at you with what appears to be a shard of glass, but she is much too far, and you easily shoot her, disintegrating her completely. [addslave][clothe][remove][playsound|laser][humansound|scream]
		The girls scream, but are too terrified to defy you after watching you murder their teacher. You approach them as they shakily take off their clothes, and trace your hands across the sobbing mass. After they are naked, they curl into various defensive postures, covering themselves from you as best they can.[humansound|scream][backgroundloop|sobbingmass][addslave][pose|cowering]

The girl cries bitterly as you pry her legs open, and lets out a scream of pain as you ram yourself into her.[humansound|scream][humansound|painfulsex][pose|missionaryrape][remove]
		There is no rush, and you take your time with each of the sobbing girls while the rest watch in terror. Some of them scream in pain, some just cry softly, and one is so afraid that she can only lie there, silent and motionless as you have your way with her. One in particular, a pretty freshman, catches your attention when she makes an honest attempt to fight you off, and you understand her resistance when you enter her.

		As they see your telltale final thrusts, the rest of the girls begin to wail in fear. One of them begins to crawl towards the door, but you shoot her in the back, and she is immediately reduced to a cloud of ash that washes over the rest of the girls.[playsound|laser][humansound|none]

VIP
An actress has arrived on your station for her vacation. Ordinarily, this would be good news, as celebrities bring obscene amounts of money and hangers-on with them. This one, however, is miserable to deal with. She is perpetually high on an aggression-inducing substance you don't recognize, and intermittently goes on rampages, damaging station and citizen property. She is always willing to pay for the damages (and your significant headache tax), but she eventually manages to kill a tourist, giving you an opportunity for proper revenge.[money|10000][AddSlave|Entitled|She was a B-list actress who you enslaved for manslaughter after she caused trouble on your station.|min/25|0/0|0/60][clothe][humansound|idle][pose|boundseated][charisma|100]
	Ban her from the station
		That is the last straw. You ban her from the station despite her protests, and your security drone escorts her back to her ship. Some of the fines go to the tourist's family, but you keep most of them. All in all, the tidy sum you have collected was worth the trouble.[money|100000][remove][hide]
	Enslave her
		You walk into the holding cell to an immediate barrage of insults, but you silence the woman with a powerful shock. You explain that penalty for murder aboard your station is enslavement. She waits for more, a request for a bribe or a disclaimer that celebrities are exempt, but receives neither.
		As she realizes that she will be facing the consequences of her actions, she immediately begins to struggle against her restraints, but they are easily strong enough to hold even her obviously augmented form. A security drone enters and collars her before dragging her to her new home.[humansound|screaming]
		This action has significantly darkened your reputation, but tourism will increase dramatically as people flock to your station to visit the actresses in the brothel, and your more justice-minded citizens respect your willingness to uphold the laws of your station regardless of the identity of the perpetrator.[humansound|none][hide][inf|50][rep|-100][tourists|10]
	Fine her, but let her remain
		You walk into her holding cell to an immediate barrage of insults, but silence her with a wave. You explain that you will let her stay, but there will be a heavy fine. She agrees halfheartedly, and pays the princely sum. She remains on your station for a few more days, continuing to rack up fines, but seems to reduce her drug intake. Some of your citizens think that you are kowtowing to the famous, and your influence suffers.[money|500000][inf|-50][remove]

{extreme}Local Tourist
One of the tourists aboard your station has caught your eye, putting her in a dangerous place. You have the station scan for any debts or outstanding warrants, but she appears to be clean, so you have no way of legally enslaving her. Still, you have options.[Addslave|||min/25|40/60|40/80][clothe]
	Ambush her in a bathroom and rape her
		You watch her through your security cameras, and mark the bathroom as out of order after she enters. You follow her and lock the door behind you. She doesn't sense a threat yet, and finishes before opening the stall to find you standing before her. She may be a tourist, but she recognizes you immediately, and is frozen in fear at the unexpected visitor.[humansound|fear][playsound|doorclose][backgroundloop|apartments]
		You reach out and begin to undo her clothes. She is too shocked and afraid to resist you, and stands motionless and hyperventilating as you unwrap her. You take off her shirt, and pull her pants down around her ankles. She lets out a meek sob as you run your hands up her thighs, but continues to stand at attention.[humansound|fear][humansound|grunt][strip]
		You firmly push her to the floor and spread her legs apart. She begins to moan slightly through her terrified breaths, but makes no attempt to stop you as you press yourself against her. She cries out in pain as you force yourself into her, but continues to lie there, her hands at her sides, as you have your way with her.[humansound|sex][humansound|scream]
		You take your time. A bathroom in the process of being cleaned will not arouse suspicion, and, according to your security systems, you were never here. After what must have seemed to her like hours, you finish inside her and pull yourself out of her, your eyes lingering on the blood and cum dripping from between her legs. She manages to gather her clothes and enter a stall before you open the door, clearly ashamed to be seen in such a miserable state. She won't tell anyone about this; nobody would believe her if she did.[hide][remove]
	Let her go
		Some things are not meant to be pursued. You decide to let her go unmolested, and turn your attention to a slave instead.[remove][hide]

{extreme}Party Girl
While enjoying a drink in your private room of the club, you notice a beautiful citizen. She's dancing competently on a raised platform, gleefully showing herself off to the assembled crowd.[Addslave|||min/25|40/60|40/80][clothe][pose|dance][environment|club]
	Have her drugged and sent up for you
		You use your complete control of the station's systems to have the bartender spike her next drink. The drugs you used were powerful, and she soon stumbles out of the club. A security drone catches her and gently carries her unconscious body up to your balcony, placing her daintily on the couch.[pose|sleeping][playsound|drone][humansound|snoring]
		You begin to remove her clothes. The drugs won't wear off for hours, so you take your time, carefully undoing her shirt and unbuttoning her pants to avoid damaging them before slowly pulling them off, unwrapping her like a delicate gift.[strip]
		You spend some time caressing her flawless body, enjoying the softness of her skin and the smell of her well-cared-for hair before spreading her legs open. [pose|missionaryprep]
		You get into position and gently push yourself into her. She groans and repositions, but the drugs will keep her unconscious for quite a while. You start slow, and you feel her shifting and tightening with pleasure. You begin to thrust faster, and her breath quickens, her body bouncing prettily with each impact. [pose|missionary]
		It doesn't take you long to finish inside the sleeping girl, and you have a security drone clothe her before taking her back to her quarters.[clothe][pose|dronehanging][remove]
	Just enjoy the show
		You watch her dance from the comfort of your private balcony. Some things are best enjoyed at a distance.[remove]

Mystery Slave
An eccentric seller has called to offer you an unusual deal. He has three sealed boxes, each containing a slave girl. For $10,000, you may pick one. Inside one of them is a valuable prize. The other two are nothing special.

{var terrorists}{extreme}Terrorist attack
Terrorists have set off a small explosive device on board your station, and caused some expensive damage.[money|-50000]
	Make an example of the perpetrators
		Your drones easily find and gather the terrorists, and have brought them to your quarters. There are two men and a woman in all. You simply have the men spaced before turning your attention to the woman.[addslave][pose|dronestruggle][clothe]
		You efficiently cut off her clothes, and have the drone take her outside and nail her to the floor of a public area in your station.[strip]
		Given the brutality your citizens are showing her, she will likely expire in a few years. Until then, she will serve as a constant reminder of what happens to those who would oppose your rule.[unset|terrorists][hide][remove]
	Kill the perpetrators
		The ubiquitous security footage makes it easy to identify the perpetrators, and your drones collect and space them. This may work in the short term, but is unlikely to solve the root of the problem.
	Create programs to reduce future terrorism (Costs $100,000)
		After dealing with the perpetrators, you invest lavishly in programs to improve quality of live aboard your station. The collective gratitude of your people quickly overwhelms any terrorist sympathies, and they return to their normal docile state.[money|-100000][unset|terrorists]

Groupie
You are distracted by a young woman talking directly into a camera on your station. She is gushing about how much she admires you, and says that she wants to be with you, even if it means being your slave. She is obviously unstable, but her devotion to you will save some time on training.[addslave|Admires you deeply|Offered herself up as your slave in order to be close to you|18/25|100/100|0/0|||Williams][clothe]

	Reject her offer
		You ignore her, and she waits by the camera for several hours, growing more and more agitated as she continues to rant into the camera. More and more heads turn towards her, and your security drones are eventually forced to intervene, lifting her up and throwing her through a portal to her homeworld. [pose|dronestruggle][remove]

Plan B
An un-contacted society on a backwater planet is having trouble with their planet's climate, and they have decided to send a small number of their people to a nearby habitable world to avoid the extinction of their culture. They appear to be unaware of other civilizations in the cosmos (likely due to a previous apocalyptic event). The ship they've sent appears to lack faster than light capability, and has embarked on the journey with the expectation that the grandchildren of the first colonists will be the first to see the new world.
	Capture the ship
		You send a small number of vessels to capture the colony ship. They are unarmed and completely surprised by the presence of other humans, and surrender without a fight. You don't have room on your station for the hundreds of colonists, so you sell the bulk of them immediately, keeping the best for yourself.[money|100000][addslave|Was a colonist leaving a dying world|You captured her ship en route to her new home and enslaved her|18/25|0/0|40/60][addslave|Was a colonist leaving a dying world|You captured her ship en route to her new home and enslaved her|18/25|0/0|40/60][addslave|Was a colonist leaving a dying world|You captured her ship en route to her new home and enslaved her|18/25|0/0|40/60][addslave|Was a colonist leaving a dying world|You captured her ship en route to her new home and enslaved her|18/25|0/0|40/60][clothe]
	Aid their progress
		You send a tugboat to latch onto their ship and pull it through a portal to their destination. Like virtually all class-M planets, their destination was occupied, but the locals were happy to send aid and terraforming supplies saving the colonists' original world. Even though your contribution was small, the galactic community recognizes the lives you saved, and your reputation has improved significantly.[rep|400]
	Do not interfere
		You leave the ship to its fate. They'll find out that they're not alone in the universe after a few generations.

Asylum
A local government is having trouble housing its mentally-ill population, and is selling some of the less-dangerous inmates of their asylums in bulk to make room for people it has a more urgent need to contain. They will likely be obedient, as they are used to confinement (and, based on the rumors of the asylum, they are also no strangers to sexual abuse).
	Buy them (Costs $10,000)
		You purchase the lot. The four inmates show up on your station in short order.[addslave|Was in a mental asylum|You purchased her from her government|18/25|0/0|0/0||N|insane][addslave|Was in a mental asylum|You purchased her from her government|18/25|0/0|0/0||N|insane][addslave|Was in a mental asylum|You purchased her from her government|18/25|100/100|0/0||N|Williams][addslave|Was in a mental asylum|You purchased her from her government|18/25|100/100|0/0||N|Williams][clothe]
	Ignore the offer
		You pass on the offer. Mental patients sound like more trouble than they're worth.

Student Debt
Your security systems detect the telltale sign of useful debt: a girl crying helplessly in her bed. It would appear that one of your residents has acquired a mountain of student debt during her education, and has failed to make payments for some time. It would be trivial to buy the debt and enslave her.[addslave|Well-educated|You purchased her unpaid student debt and enslaved her|21/24|50/80|40/80][clothe]
	Just enslave her (Costs $10,000)
		You purchase the debt and have a security drone visit her in her quarters. She cries harder, but was emotionally prepared for this, and wordlessly follows the drone as it leads her away for processing.[money|-10000]
	Leave her alone
		She's not worth the trouble. Someone else will pick her up eventually.[remove]

{notvar CultEncouraged}Cult
A strange cult has taken root on your station. They worship technology, and see this place as a sort of holy ground. While they are slightly disturbing to others, they seem harmless, and conduct most of their business (which, judging by the security footage, involves a lot of group sex) in the relative privacy of their leader's quarters.
	Subvert and replace their leader
		You send a message to the cult leader, explaining that he has a week to direct his following to worship you instead. He protests initially, but you both know that he is not a true believer, and he recognizes your authority aboard your station.
		Over the next days (and with the help of a sermon you record for the cult), ownership of the cult has been transferred to you, and the leader has left for another station to begin anew. The members submit to you completely, and two members appear at your suite, humbly offering themselves to you.[addslave|Member of a cult dedicated to you|Offered herself as your slave to be closer to you|18/22|100/100|0/100|||Obsessed][addslave|Member of a cult dedicated to you|Offered herself as your slave to be closer to you|18/22|100/100|0/100|||Obsessed][set|CultEncouraged]
	Disperse them
		You send a message to the leader, explaining that you are putting a stop to the cult, and that they must disperse at once. The leader appears to be a pragmatic man despite his following, and shepherds the cultists to another station. Your citizens are relieved at the cult's disappearance, and your reputation has improved.[rep|200][inf|200]
	Ignore them
		You simply ignore the cult. They're not worth your time.

{extreme}Race
Another stationmaster has invited you to an event he's hosting, in which a group of slaves will run a race. Any slave who crosses the finish line will be freed, but a few stationmasters will be on the side of the track with stun guns. Anyone who manages to stun a slave will get to keep her.
	Attend
		As you arrive at the station, you see that the gate room has been closed off and properly decorated for the arrival of such distinguished guests. An obedient slave ushers you and your competitors into the center of the racetrack, where your stun rifles are waiting. After she takes a few minutes to explain the rules, she raises and fires the starting pistol, and three slaves come running from the starting line. Today, there is an athlete who is doing her best to cross, a teenager who is close behind, and an obedient slave who is giggling and blowing kisses at you as she runs.
			Aim for the teenager
				You take aim and take a shot directly into the teenager's belly. She collapses immediately as the electricity from the stun gun courses through her body.[addslave|Orphan|You won her in a shooting game aboard a rival's station|18/18|50/60|30/50][humansound|screaming][pose|facedownonground]

The crowd cheers as you rape your new acquisition on the dusty floor, and you soon allow yourself to finish inside her, keeping the encounter tastefully brief for the sake of your audience.[humansound|screaming][pose|missionaryrape][sex]
				You grab her by the hair before she has a chance to catch her breath, and drag her through the exit and into the portal to your station. Your rival thanks you for attending his event, and the public spectacle has improved your reputation.[rep|100]

				You help her up, and she obediently follows you through the exit and into the portal to your station. Your rival thanks you for attending his event, and the public spectacle has improved your reputation.[rep|100]
			Shoot the greeter
 				You quickly turn around and shoot the greeter in the belly. The other stationmasters, seeing what you have done, roar with laughter, and the three running slaves all manage to cross the finish line. The greeter is curled up onto the ground, her body twitching slightly as the electricity from the stun projectile courses through it.[addslave|Was once the concubine of another stationmaster|You exploited a loophole in a gaming contract to gain ownership of her|18/18|50/60|30/50]
 				After what was surely a very careful review of the contract, the host acknowledges that it didn't specify that you had to shoot a running slave. He begrudgingly transfers ownership of his concubine to you, and you thank him before taking her, sobbing, from the station.
	Don't attend
		You have better things to do than attend a rival's party. You swiftly decline the invitation. 

Hitchhiker
On your way back from a short business jaunt to a nearby world, you came across a teenage hitchhiker asking for a ride to her home planet. She looks slightly ragged, but pretty underneath the thin layer of dirt. She is likely a runaway, and you're sure she hasn't told anyone of her plans.[addslave|Free spirit|You kept her after she foolishly hitchhiked aboard your ship|18/18|0/0|50/70][clothe]
	Return her to her parents
		You strike up a conversation, and learn that she has run away from her wealthy parents as an act of defiance. You offer her a ride, and she doesn't think twice before accepting. She realizes almost immediately that you are not taking her to her requested destination, and, immediately afterwards, that the seat belt she is wearing is actually a restraint system. 
		Despite the kidnapping, she sighs with relief as she realizes that you're only delivering her to her parents. You contact them ahead of time to let them know that you have their daughter, and, even before you land, they wire you a reward of $50,000. They quickly grab their daughter as you land, and the mother mouths a quick thanks before tending to her crying daughter.[money|50000][remove]
	{extreme}Trick her into getting into your ship and enslave her

She realizes almost immediately that you are not taking her to her requested destination, and, immediately afterwards, that the seat belt she is wearing is actually a restraint system.
		She screams and struggles for the entire trip to your station, but she is helpless against the binds on her chair, and can only buck feebly as a security drone drags her away for processing. [humansound|screaming]
	Pass her by
		You leave her for someone else to take care of. Based on your experience, she will likely be entombed in an arcade booth within the week.[remove]

Acquisition
A small nearby station has focused too much on the pleasure of its owner, and not enough on business (a relatively common pitfall for inexperienced stationmasters). He has fallen into a crippling drug addiction, and is selling his assets at a deep discount to avoid the harsh consequences of bankruptcy.
	Buy them (costs $10,000)
		You place the winning bid on the stationmaster's assets. You manage to turn a profit on the station itself by leveraging your connections to find a proper buyer, and keep his three prized slaves for yourself.[money|100000][addslave|Exceptionally well-trained|She was a concubine of another stationmaster before he fell into drug addiction and auctioned his assets|18/18|100/100|0/0||N][addslave|Exceptionally well-trained|She was a concubine of another stationmaster before he fell into drug addiction and auctioned his assets|18/18|100/100|0/0||N][addslave|Exceptionally well-trained|She was a concubine of another stationmaster before he fell into drug addiction and auctioned his assets|18/18|100/100|0/0||N]
	Ignore the offer
		You dismiss the notification. Someone else can bail him out.

Wild West
Your station has detected human life on an uncharted world. It would appear that most of the surface was destroyed in a long-forgotten nuclear holocaust, but the radiation has declined to the point that the area is now habitable. The rough frontier colonists appear to be armed only with basic gunpowder hunting weapons, and would have no way of penetrating your augmented skin.
	Pay them a visit
		You take your ship down outside of a small town in the frontier area. Scans show multiple houses within a few miles of your position, so you simply head for the nearest one.
		As you approach the isolated cabin, you see the lights go out. It appears that whoever was inside saw you coming, and is trying to make the cabin look unoccupied.
		The door is locked, but not designed to stand up to augmented strength. The wood splinters and disintegrates as you twist the handle, and you drop the ruined iron knob to the ground before stepping inside. As you enter, you hear heavy breathing behind you.[humansound|fear]
		Before you can turn around, you feel the cold metal of a rifle barrel against the back of your head. It's shaking significantly, and it's obvious that whoever is on the other end has never killed someone before. 
		You hear a click, followed by a deafening crack as the bullet fires, then immediately ricochets off of your augmented skin, destroying the crude firearm completely. The woman holding the gun screams in pain as the force of the double impact rips the ruined gun from her hands.[addslave|Cowgirl|You kidnapped her from her ranch|18/22|50/60|100/100][clothe]
		You punch her in the gut, and she immediately drops to the floor. With a well-practiced efficiency, you cut off her clothes as she desperately tries to regain her breath.[strip][pose|missionaryrapeprep][humansound|screaming]
		You get into position between her legs and force yourself into her without preamble. You take your time, sampling her in several positions as she writhes helplessly against your grip. She eventually goes limp and follows your lead, her screaming long since reduced to pitiful sobbing. [humansound|painfulsex][pose|missionaryrape]
		After a while, you allow yourself to finish her, and pull out, leaving her a sobbing heap on the floor. You grab her by the hair and drag her limp form back to your ship.[macro|postrape][sex]
	Ignore them
		You ignore the planet for now. You have better things to do than play black-hat.

Settlers
Your probes receive a distress call from a desolate world. It would appear that a ship crash-landed on the planet, marooning the survivors. According to the signal, they have limited life support, and will only last a few more days without intervention. You only picked up the signal by pure chance, and it's unlikely that anyone else will have heard it before they expire.
	Rescue them
		You send a small ship to collect the survivors and deposit them at their chosen destinations. The castaways thank you profusely, and pool their money to pay you for your rescue. Your reputation has improved, and you have earned $100,000. [money|100000][rep|100] 
	Enslave them
		You send a small ship to collect them for enslavement. They all board eagerly, even knowing that the ship may be leading them anywhere. Based on their interactions, it appears that they are a family, and were attempting to settle on a different world. They are shocked when you tell them that they are being carried off to a life of slavery, and the survivors weep bitterly when your ship jettisons the men of the crew (evidently the father and brother). Your security drones process the rest of the family without incident.[addslave|Field medic|You captured her from the wreckage of a crash landing|18/18|30/60|30/60][addslave|Smart, but useless|You captured her from the wreckage of a crash landing|18/18|30/60|30/60][addslave|Brilliant aerospace engineer|You captured her from the wreckage of a crash landing|40/45|30/60|30/60||N][addslave|Manipulative psychopath|You captured her from the wreckage of a crash landing|30/40|30/60|30/60||N|Insane]
	Ignore them
		You dismiss the call. They're not worth the effort.

The Long Game
Life as a stationmaster can get tiring. Sometimes, you look at the simple lives of primitive people, and wonder what it's like to be unconcerned with anything more than your next meal. Thinking about it, your station's computer is more than capable of running operations for a few months while you take a much-needed break.
	Live as a commoner for a few months
		You select a world that is disconnected from the galactic community, and touch down in a remote area. It's trivial for your station's computer to create an identity for you, complete with government records, a penthouse suite in a large city, and a bank balance that will allow you any lifestyle you wish while you're here.
		The people of this world are unaltered save for some primitive plastic surgery, and your carefully-engineered appearance stands out much more here than it does on your station. You spend most of your first few days in bars and clubs, enjoying the local food, drinks, and populace with ease.
		The clubs are only marginally different from your station's own bars though, and the real appeal of a place like this is your complete anonymity. Searching through what passes for matchmaking services on this planet, you find a few candidates, and eventually narrow your search down to [name], a woman who, despite her primitive background, could be a worthy acquisition.[addslave|Hopelessly in love with the man she thought you were|You vacationed on her planet, dated her, and enslaved her when you left|18/20|30/70|100/100][clothe]
		It would be simplest just to kidnap her and take her away, but you're here for a diversion, not business. You have your station hack the matchmaking app, and have it present you as her ideal partner. Within minutes, you receive a message from her asking for a date.
		You spend time getting to know the woman. She is a student at a local university, working on a dissertation on a theoretical method of faster-than-light travel. It's quite off-base, but it could lead to productive results in a few of their generations. You use your centuries of diplomatic experience to charm her, and it's clear that she has completely fallen for you by the time the check arrives. You ask her if she wants to come up to your suite, and she eagerly accepts.[pose|boundseated]
		As soon as the door closes, she kisses you passionately and begins to work on your clothes. It's only a few seconds before you're both naked, and she eagerly jumps up onto you, wrapping her arms and legs around you while gently grinding herself on your stomach.[strip]
		You push her down to the bed, and she gasps as you slide into her. It's not often that you have a genuinely eager woman, and you savor the uncommon experience. After a pleasant hour, you allow yourself to finish inside her, and she almost immediately falls asleep in your arms, smiling.[pose|missionary][sex]
		You continue to wander during the days, but you find yourself spending most of your time with [name]. Your functionally infinite means allow you to take her on lavish dates that would be unachievable for her social class, and she appreciates the new experiences almost as much as she appreciates your company. In another life, it may have even been agreeable to settle down with her, and it's obvious that she's helplessly in love with you.[clothe][pose|idle]
		As pleasant a distraction as this has been, there is a growing list of matters on your station that you must attend to. You tell her that you have a surprise planned, and hold out a blindfold. She gleefully accepts the romantic gesture, and puts it over her eyes. You take her keys, and begin to drive her out to where you parked your ship.[pose|boundseated]
		You gently guide her out of the car, and tell her to remove her blindfold. Your ship is invisible at first, but you send a mental command to disable the cloaking, and her eager smile is replaced by slack-jawed shock as she sees your ship materialize out of thin air in front of her. [pose|idle]
		She is too busy staring at the ship to notice as you pull a shock stick out of your jacket, and her first clue comes as you jab it into her ribs, instantly knocking her off her feat. She screams in pain as the electricity courses through her body, and she looks at you with confusion as she twitches helplessly on the ground.[pose|facedownonground][humansound|scream][humansound|crying]
		You take her by her hair and drag her onto your ship. She is too overcome by shock and confusion to resist as you strap her into the restraint system and begin the takeoff sequence.[pose|boundseated]
		You return to your station as your crying souvenir begs you for answers, desperately appealing to the man she thought you were. When you arrive, a security drone is already prepared to take her away for processing. 
	That sounds like a pointless distraction
		You dismiss the thought. The opportunity cost of living as a commoner is simply too high.

Rival Stationmaster
You receive a message from the master of a nearby station. She appears to be aiming for a buyout, and is offering a considerable amount of money for your empire. You refuse, of course, and search your records for information on her. She has substantial investments (mostly inherited from her parents), but that they are not diversified, and some careful economic manipulation could quickly render her destitute.[addslave|Used to be a rival administrator|You used financial malfeasance to steal her station and her freedom|25/35|30/60|50/100|||Leader][clothe]
	Crush her
		You take advantage of her lack of experience and place numerous articles hinting of the imminent collapse of your station in her various news feeds. At the same time, you bribe her broker to convince her to short your station at a ridiculous price, and sell you the options.
		On the exercise date of the options, you announce your incredible profits (helped by some creative accounting), driving the stock of your station up astronomically. Your rival finds herself unable to afford the cost of honoring the options, putting her in deep debt to you as you exercise them.
		She knows exactly what happened, of course, but it would be impossible to prove wrongdoing in this complex financial landscape. She arrives on your station when you summon her, and is not surprised when you tell her that she is now your slave.
		As your security drones escort her slaves away for processing, you keep her in your suite, and direct her attention to a monitor showing her station. At your silent command, a ripple of energy can be seen emanating from the center as a set of demolition charges rip it apart. It may have been an expensive lesson to teach, but it's important that future rivals learn the cost of defiance.[money|1000000][reputation|-1000][influence|1000][addslave|Excellent cook|Belonged to [name] before you enslaved her and took her possessions|18/20|30/60|50/100||v][addslave|Good at cleaning|Belonged to [name] before you enslaved her and took her possessions|18/20|30/60|50/100||v][addslave|Expert masseuse|Belonged to [name] before you enslaved her and took her possessions|18/20|30/60|50/100||v]

		You simply block her from contacting you. You would never sell your station, and you don't have shareholders, so you don't have to worry about a hostile takeover.[remove]

{notvar machinesappeased}Mechanical Masters
Immediately after a probe left hyperspace near a dark planet, it received a message from the surface with an unusual proposal. It would appear that the humans of the planet are no longer the dominant species after a takeover by a machine race called the Inheritors. The machines keep the humans alive in pods, connected to a shared virtual reality, and use them to barter with other powers. They offer you a steady supply of sealed pods, and all they ask in exchange is that you leave them alone.
	Accept their offer
		Your probe almost immediately detects an incoming projectile with a single life sign. It manages to catch the orange pod, and drag it back to your station.
		When you open the pod, a woman stumbles out. She is naked, and covered in a sticky slime from the pod's systems. She tries to move, but her muscles are deeply atrophied from a life lived without movement, and she can barely stumble forward before she falls to the ground.[addslave|Was bred by machines to be used as a bargaining chip|The machines that run her world gifted her to you in exchange for peace|18/20|100/100|100/100][pose|facedownonground][humansound|fear]

	Decline their offer
		The signal goes dark. Further attempts to communicate with the machine world are met with silence.

{var machinesappeased}Inheritors' Favor
Your station's sensors detect an incoming projectile with a single life sign. It appears to be a gift from the Inheritors. You have a security drone collect the pod and extract the unconscious woman inside for processing.[addslave|Was bred by machines to be used as a bargaining chip|The machines that run her world gifted her to you in exchange for peace|18/20|100/100|100/100][pose|facedownonground][humansound|fear]

{Extreme}Superheroine
An augmented woman has taken it upon herself to cause havoc on your station. She appears to have purchased augmentations that give her superhuman abilities, and has taken to patrolling your station and interrupting your people as they use your slaves. While she hasn't done any serious damage, she has remained out of reach of your security drones, always escaping into the machinery of your station just before she can be captured. However, in a lucky stroke, her mask caught on a panel as she was escaping her last assault, and you were able to identify her as one of your citizens, who has a wife aboard your station.[addslave|Wannabe superheroine|You captured her after she assaulted several of your patrons in a ridiculous spandex costume|18/20|0/0|0/0][clothe]
	Draw her to you by arresting her wife
		Her wife is terrified when a security drone arrests her. She is apparently aware of your superheroine's secret life, and remains frozen in fear as you explain the charges. You take her up to your office, and begin to wait.[addslave|Was married to a wannabe superheroine|You enslaved her to draw out her wife|18/20|30/60|30/60][select|1][pose|boundseated][humansound|fear]
		Hours pass without an attack, and you decide to deliver a message. You engage the emergency broadcast system, and display a feed to the heroine's wife to every screen on the station. She is tied to a chair, and she writhes against her bonds as approach and begin to caress her body.
		As you slide your hand down the bound woman's pants, you hear a bestial scream coming from outside your office door. The heroine charges through the door of your suite. Unfortunately for her, your security drones are more than a match for her in a head-on confrontation, and they overwhelm her before she can touch you. You pull your hand from her wife's pants and turn your attention to the snarling woman in front of you.[select|0][pose|dronemissionaryprep][resetcamera][humansound|screaming]
		You reach around to the back of her neck, and expertly crush the implant controller. She screams in pain as her implants short out, and her struggling weakens instantaneously as she loses control of her augmentations. Both women scream and struggle as your security drones drag them away for processing, but they are completely outmatched.
	Send her a message saying that you know who she is
		You quietly send a message to her private terminal, saying simply that you know about her hobby. A few minutes later, you hear word that she has taken her wife and left your station, leaving their belongings behind. It is unlikely that she will return.[remove][hide]

Cryo Pods
A ship has entered your sensor range. It is broadcasting a wide-spectrum distress signal. According to the message, it is from a world that has not yet mastered faster-than-light travel, and contains several cryogenically-frozen travelers. A meteor storm has knocked them off course, and, if left to their own devices, they will drift until they run out of power and inevitably perish. It would be trivial to rescue the ship, though there is no way of knowing anything about the people on board.
	Rescue the ship
		You have a tugboat warp the ship back to where it should be, and wipe the logs of any evidence. If it doesn't meet with another meteor storm, it should make it to its destination on schedule. Nobody will ever know what you did here, but you have certainly saved the lives of the crew.
	Enslave the passengers
		You redirect the ship to your station, and walk aboard to view the captures. Moving through the pods, you see several holy men (who you jettison), and three women. Immediately after thawing, two of the women are groggy and terrified (as you'd expect), but the third lunges at your security drone in a bestial rage, and has to be pinned by a security drone and shocked into submission before being dragged away for processing.[addslave|Hardened Criminal|You "rescued" her from a cryo pod on a derelict ship|18/18|0/0|0/0][addslave|Pretty good pilot|You "rescued" her from a cryo pod on a derelict ship|28/28|20/20|60/60][addslave|Prospector|You "rescued" her from a cryo pod on a derelict ship|24/24|20/20|60/60]
	Leave them to die
		You leave the ship to drift. Interfering with primitive cultures can have unpredictable side effects.

{extreme}Couple
As you sit at the bar on your station, you see a nauseatingly affectionate couple at a nearby table. Your records show that they are newlyweds, and, despite their carefree attitude, are deeply in debt. It would be trivial to buy enough debt to enslave them both.[addslave|Terrible with money|You enslaved her with her husband when they defaulted on their student debt.|18/20|40/60|40/100||N][clothe]
	Enslave them (Costs $10,000)
		With a thought, you purchase their debt, giving you the right to enslave both of them. It's incredible that people are stupid enough to default on this much debt when the consequences are so dire, but you know better than most that there will always be idiots.
		You have legal access to their property as their owner, so you let yourself into their cramped quarters and wait for them to come home.
		You don't have to wait long, and they soon emerge to find you sitting motionless on the side of their bed. They scream and try to run away, but the door locks behind them, trapping them in the room with you and a security drone.[humansound|scream][humansound|fear]
		The drone launches at the husband with incredible speed and pins him to the ceiling, forcing him to watch as you turn your attention to his wife. She kicks and screams, but can't stop you from pushing her down to the bed.[pose|missionaryrapeprep][humansound|screaming]
		You tear at her clothes with deceptive precision, stripping her naked in a matter of seconds. You perceive the husband trying desperately to escape above you, but he's pinned in place by the drone, and completely unable to move.[strip]
		She screams louder as you force yourself into her, and you hear her husband scream as well as he realizes what you've done. You lazily thrust into her, ignoring her struggles and the noise from above as you focus on enjoying your new toy.[pose|missionaryrape][sex]
		You eventually allow yourself to finish inside her, and get up off the bed, leaving her curled in the fetal position. At your mental command, the drone eviscerates the man, showering the room with gore. It tosses his remains aside, and drags your inconsolable new slave away for processing.[macro|postrape][money|-10000]
	Ignore them
		They eventually leave the bar, and you continue to sip your drink in peace.[remove]

{extreme}Backpacker
A well-known adventurer has been documenting a long route off the grid. She goes to uninhabited planets, films a long hike on each one, and makes a show of the highlights. She's aware of the dangers of being outside any government's jurisdiction, and takes pains to conceal her position. Unfortunately for her, she slipped up, and accidentally transmitted a personally-identifiable packet on an open frequency. You know where she is, and where she's going.
	Pick her up
		You plot the backpacker's route, and find an isolated point that she is sure to pass through. You land your ship in a concealed thicket and sit inside, waiting for her.[playsound|land][backgroundloop|rural][AddSlave|Was once a celebrity traveler|You used your station's computer to track and capture her.|min/25|40/60|100/100||N][clothe]

You easily pin her with a hand to her throat, and you carefully control the pressure, keeping her on the edge of unconsciousness as you pull down her pants.[strip|legs][humansound|coughing][pose|missionaryrapeprep]
		You allow her to breathe again once you have her pinned and naked from the waist down, and she screams in pain as you force yourself into her. It's not often that you spend time in nature, and you savor it, violating her for hours as she slowly transitions from attempts at escape, to defiant screaming, to weak sobbing.[humansound|scream][humansound|painfulsex][pose|missionaryrape]
		When you finally finish in her, you feel her tense up slightly, but she is too weak to react beyond that. She doesn't move as you get up, and sobs bitterly as you drag her to your ship.[pose|facedownonground]
	Let her go
		As tempting as she is, it's best to let her show continue.

{extreme}Campers
Your scans have picked up a family of four campers (two mothers and two daughters) on a nearby world. They're flying a relatively cheap ship, and it's likely that they have nowhere else to live. They have taken pains to mask their outgoing signals, but the ancient ship they drove leaked enough energy from the drive to shine like a beacon, at least to your probes. There wouldn't be any consequences if you enslaved them, or even if you had some sadistic fun first.
	Enslave them all
		You take a ship to the campsite. The four women immediately make a dash for their ship as soon as they see you approaching, but a well-placed laser from your fighter cuts through the engine, grounding it irreparably. You land next to the family, and explain that you'll be taking them back to your station. One of the mothers screams and charges at you, but a security drone quickly restrains her, and the rest of the girls line up and march onto your ship with no further resistance. It takes very little time to take off and return to your station with the four new toys.[Addslave|Outdoorsy|You kidnapped her with her family when they were camping on an uninhabited planet|min/min|0/50|0/50||V][Addslave|Indoorsy|You kidnapped her with her family when they were camping on an uninhabited planet|min/min|0/50|0/50||V][Addslave|Adventurous|You kidnapped her with her family when they were camping on an uninhabited planet|36/45|0/50|0/50||N][Addslave|Fiercely protective of her daughters|You kidnapped her with her family when they were camping on an uninhabited planet|36/45|0/50|0/50||N]

		You wait until after dark in the rural region, and set your ship down outside the tent of the family. You stealthily approach, and you can see them sitting around their campfire, telling each other ghost stories. They sit and talk for hours, laughing amongst themselves and saying goodnight before eventually separating into their tents and going to sleep.[Addslave|Outdoorsy|You kidnapped her with her sister after raping her entire family in the woods|min/min|50/100|100/100][clothe][expression|happy][pose|boundseated][backgroundloop|rural]
		Once you're certain that they're asleep in their tents, you approach the tent of the elder sister. You carefully cut your way through the cloth, and wake her by clamping a hand over her mouth. The forest is loud enough that nobody heard the pitiful squeak that escaped through your fingers, and she went silent when she saw the intimidating knife in your hand. [humansound|fear][pose|sleeping]
		You tell her that you will allow her to live, but only if she keeps quiet. After a moment, she nods, and your experience with terrified women assures you that she is genuine.
		You remove your hand from her mouth, and tell her to unzip her sleeping bag. She shakily slides down the zipper, and you see that she is naked underneath. [playsound|unzip][strip]
		She begins to quietly sob as you caress her breast, but you stop there, knowing that there will be time for that later. For now, you simply pull her from her ruined tent and shackle her to a nearby tree.[humansound|sobbing][playsound|shackle][pose|idle]
		You cut into the next sister's tent, and find her awake, reading a book and facing away from the hole with earbuds playing loud music.

		She looks terrified as you explain that you will cut her throat if she screams, and clamps her hands over her mouth. At your command, she slowly unzips her sleeping bag and gets out. She is dressed, but won't be for long.[playsound|unzip]
		You take her over to the tree and shackle her next to her naked sister.[playsound|shackle][pose|idle]
		Their mothers share a tent, so you take extra care to be quiet as you slice a hole in the side. They are fast asleep in each other's arms, apparently post-coital, and don't wake as you drag a chain around a nearby tree, and attach it around each of their necks. [humansound|snoring][addslave][select|2]
		You cut the tent away from above them, leaving them naked in their shared sleeping bag under the stars, but they are in a deep sleep, and don't wake at the noise.[playsound|shackle]
		You walk back to the daughters and begin to grope the eldest. It doesn't matter if she screams now, so you decide to see how much she can take before she can't help it anymore. You start slowly, gently touching her nipples. You see tears running down her face, but she has enough willpower to suppress anything beyond quiet sobbing.[select|0][humansound|sobbing]
		You move a hand between her legs, and she begins to cry louder as your finger caresses her labia. Her mothers stir, but don't wake at the sound, so you try the younger daughter. [select|0][humansound|crying]
		She meekly tries to push you away as you bring a hand to the zipper of her sweater, but can't stop you from slowly sliding it down, revealing her bra.[playsound|unzip][strip|shirt][clothe|bra][humansound|fear]
		You slide your hands around her bare stomach, enjoying the warmth of her skin before reaching around her and unclasping her bra. Her nipples harden as they meet the cold air, but she maintains her terrified silence.
		You slide her pants down to her ankles, and she can't help but let out a terrified squeal as you draw a finger up her inner thigh.[select|1][strip|pants]
		The mothers wake, and immediately see you touching their daughters. They both scream and make a wild lunge, but are immediately clotheslined by the collars around their necks. They are both brought crashing to the ground, gasping through their crushed windpipes.[humansound|scream][humansound|coughing][select|2]
		You smile at them, and continue with the youngest daughter. You gingerly take your panties between your fingers, and slide them down to her ankles. She can no longer contain the tears, and she begins to cry bitterly as you gently slide a finger into her.[strip][humansound|scream][humansound|crying][select|1]
		As fun as this has been, it's time for the main course. You walk up to the mothers and bind them together in a cruel parody of a lovers' embrace, exposed for your pleasure. You then turn your attention to the daughters, and tie them the same way as they beg for mercy.[humansound|begging]
		You position them such that they can all see each-other properly, and gracelessly force yourself into the eldest daughter. The women scream as one, and the mothers beg you to take them instead, but you continue undeterred (they will have their turn, after all).[humansound|screams][humansound|painfulsex][select|1][pose|doggyrape]

She screams in agony, and you feel her hymen tear as you force your way into her.[humansound|scream][humansound|painfulsex][select|0][pose|missionaryrape]
		You take your time alternating between the girls, and you wait until you feel each of them tighten in orgasm before turning your attention to their sobbing mothers.[select|1][humansound|screaming][pose|doggyrape]
		The mothers are begging and sobbing wrecks from being forced to watch the spectacle, but still manage to struggle helplessly against you as you position yourself. You are already well-lubricated from raping their daughters, and it doesn't take much effort to enter them.[select|2][pose|missionaryrape][humansound|painfulsex]
		You make sure the daughters watch as you violate the sobbing women, but you grow bored of them quickly. You draw your knife and begin to dig it between the ribs of the woman on top. She screams with her daughters, but the woman on the bottom doesn't realize what you've done until the blood reaches her stomach. You enjoy the feeling of her muscles spasming as she fades away. When you feel her relax, you turn the mothers around, and do the same to the second, forcing yourself into her before driving your knife into her lung. You finish in her as you feel the last of the life drain from her body.[remove]
		You pull yourself out of the dead woman and lift the bitterly sobbing daughters off the ground by their ropes. They kick and scream, but are unable to stop you from bringing them to your ship. You secure them into the restraint system, and begin the journey home with your two new slaves.[select|0][humansound|sobbing][pose|boundseated]

{extreme}Slasher
A sorority from a backwater college is having a party on an uninhabited world. It's an incredibly risky choice given the number of opportunists at play in lawless systems, but civilized societies often prohibit drugs and alcohol, so they're still popular choices among the young and reckless.
	Have some fun
		You set your ship down near the sorority party. Using your ship's scanners, you identify six distinct life signs. You direct your ship's shields to project a sphere in a half-mile radius to prevent escape, before landing and entering the cabin through a basement hatch. You stay hidden until the party begins to wind down for the night, and some of the girls have passed out in their respective bedrooms.
		You quietly open the door to the least attractive of the girls, and see her passed out, fully-clothed, on the bed. You quietly approach, hold your hand to her mouth, and cut her throat before she can scream.[addslave][clothe][pose|sleeping][humansound|snoring][remove]
		Still unnoticed, you move to the second girl's room. She is also passed out, but much prettier. You approach her and begin to gently strip her, enjoying the warmth of her flushed skin as your hands run through the motions of disrobing her. [addslave][clothe][pose|sleeping]
		She begins to wake as you caress her, so you cover her mouth before she can scream, and she quickly feels your weight on top of her. She tries to break free as you force yourself into her, but it's a pointless endeavor. You mechanically violate her on her bed, and lose interest in her quickly, so you unceremoniously drive a knife into her gut, and finish in her as she bleeds out on her bed.[strip][pose|missionaryrape][remove]
		You leave for the night, returning to your ship to watch them through its sensors. You hear blood-curdling screams as they discover the bodies, and the remaining girls sprint to their ship. Unfortunately for them, your shields are still up, and their ship collides with the shield as if it hit a solid wall. Their ship was low enough that the crash couldn't have been immediately fatal to the girls, but it is clearly inoperable.[hide]
		Panic sets in at this point, and two of them manage to claw their way out of the ship and sprint into the forest together. The remaining two stay in the ship, and, on closer examination, it appears that they were both pinned by the crash, and one of them is bleeding badly. They scream as they see you approach, and struggle to break free, but are unable to budge as you decide what to do with them.[addslave]
		You approach the ship and tear the roof off, tearing through the cheap craft like so much tissue paper. You start with the dying girl. She has a deep wound in her stomach from the crash, and they both watch helplessly as you slowly push a finger into it, followed by your whole hand.[pose|boundseated][humansound|screaming] 
		She will most likely die before you can get her medical attention, so you decide to put her out of her misery. You reach up underneath her ribcage, grab her heart, and rip it from her chest. The screams stop instantly as she collapses in her seat.[remove]
		You turn to the second girl, and her sobs turn to terrified hyperventilation, but you merely bind her to the car and walk off to find their remaining friends. She's not going anywhere, and you decide to save her for last. You walk off to find the other girls.[AddSlave|Mentally scarred|You captured her from a cabin in the woods after forcing her to watch you murder her friend.|min/22|40/60|100/100||virgin]
		It's not difficult to find the remaining pair. They are following the wall made by your shields, and making quite a lot of noise as they try to find a weakness. It seems that they have seen too many horror movies, and think that escape from this situation is possible. You stealthily follow them, listening into their conversations and surmising that they are lovers. You follow them until they become too tired to move, and fall asleep in each others' arms on the forest floor.[AddSlave|Lesbian, mentally scarred|You captured her from a cabin in the woods after forcing her to murder her lover.|min/22|40/60|100/100][select|1][clothe]
		Once you're sure that they are asleep, you carefully approach and place a dull knife in each of the girls' hands, before directing the ship to focus the shield into an arena, just for them. 
		You knock on the shield to wake them up, and they immediately scream, but you silence them by brandishing your weapon. You announce that only one of them will be allowed to survive, and point to the dull knives in their hands. After a moment of dawning comprehension, they both begin to beg and sob, but you continue to stare, unmoving. [humansound|crying]
		They begin to tearfully discuss which one should live, and it becomes clear that neither of them intends to die. They embrace, and the stronger of them stealthily draws her knife and drives it into the back of her lover. It was not a fatal wound, but it was enough to bring her to the ground in pain. [addslave][select|2][clothe][pose|facedownonground][remove][humansound|screaming]
		The instigator stabs her again and again, screaming and crying, before turning to you with a look of pure hatred. You smile, and, as you bring down the force field, she immediately rushes at you with the knife raised above her head. You let her come, and the dull blade glances harmlessly off of your augmented skin.[select|1][humansound|fear]
		Ignoring her impotent assault, you grab her by the arm and throw her over your shoulder. She kicks and screams against your grip, but is helpless to stop you as you return to her trapped friend. You tear open the ship and retrieve the second girl, throwing her over your other shoulder and carrying them both, kicking and screaming, into your ship. [humansound|screaming]

It's been some time since you found the location of the Fae homeworld, and your station has spent it well. You have conducted substantial research on the Fae's technology, and upgraded your security drones to better counter what you now know is an engineered organ that allows slight temporal distortion. You have also placed hundreds of cloaked drones and missiles in orbit the planet, and all of the preparations for a decisive attack have been made.
	Launch the attack
		The Fae defenses are impressive, but rely more on concealment than robustness. They are practically worthless against someone who knows the location of the world, but it would have been virtually impossible to find them without the help of your traitor.
		At your mental command, all of your equipment in orbit around the planet simultaneously descends on the unsuspecting creatures below. Their cannons fire upon your drones, but they seem to be specifically tailored to destroy large ships, and are almost useless against your tiny antimatter missiles.
		Within minutes, the Fae military has been annihilated, and drones have begun to arrest and process the creatures. They were completely taken by surprise, and had no idea that their secret had been leaked until it was far too late.
		You have the Fae leadership sent to your station, and set the rest of the world up as a slave factory. News of your conquest spreads quickly, and demand for Fae from the homeworld is sure to bring in a great deal of money for the foreseeable future.[addslave|Was once the queen of the Fae|You captured her during a surprise attack on the Fae homeworld|10000/50000|0/0|40/60|Ophelia|N|Fae/Ophelia]future.[addslave|Was once a Fae princess|You captured her during a surprise attack on the Fae homeworld|5000/10000|0/0|40/60||N|Fae][addslave|Was once a Fae princess|You captured her during a surprise attack on the Fae homeworld|5000/10000|0/0|40/60||N|Fae][upgrade|FaeSubjugation][set|faeHomeworldDestroyed][money|5000000]

She holds out her hand, revealing a small metal sphere. Before you can say a word, she launches it at your chest. It dissolves on impact, and the dust burrows into the skin of your prosthetic body. You feel the nanites coursing through you. Upgrading. Reconfiguring. Building.
When the sensation subsides, you feel a new sense of the people aboard your station. Their inner lives feel almost physical, like a shimmering field just within your grasp.
At a hunch, you reach out and touch the mind of a nearby slave. She stops in her tracks, and you find that you can feel her thoughts as if they were your own, even mould them to your liking.
"The Heart of Entropy. A powerful tool, with practice. Organic minds are as vulnerable to hacking as any machine."
The android vanishes as suddenly as she appeared, leaving only a crackle of static in the air.
You can now use the Heart of Entropy to brainwash slaves from the inspection screen.[var|heartofentropy]

{extreme}Theme Park
A local planet has been conquered by another station master, and he has set up a brilliant way of monetizing the inhabitants. For a fee, you can visit the planet for a week and do whatever you want with the inhabitants in a 1-mile square around your starting location. If you decide to kill someone or take them home as a souvenir, you can buy them at standard slave prices. Business is booming, and it might be time for a vacation. The park has just opened for business, so the people of the planet are only vaguely aware of what is in store for them.
	Visit the theme park (Costs $10,000)
		As soon as the payment has cleared, you receive a message detailing your assigned time and location, as well as brief biographies of the residents within your jurisdiction. You have chosen a suburban area, and been assigned to a block of midrange houses. The obvious choice is a 18-year-old student who lives in one of the houses nearest to your transit zone.[addslave|Was unlucky enough to live on a world conquered by an opportunist|You paid to use her block as a theme park, and took her home as a souvenir after murdering her parents in front of her|18/18|50/60|80/100]
		You land in the makeshift spaceport, and take a transit pod to the block that you've been assigned. It's night time, and the residents are asleep and unaware of your presence. You easily find the house of your target, and carefully cut out the glass before climbing in through the window.[humansound|snoring][pose|sleeping]
		You wake the girl by grabbing her hair and pushing her face into the pillow. She tries to scream, but can barely breathe through the heavy cloth, and barely has time to comprehend what is happening as you pull down her pajamas.[strip|pants][pose|doggyrapeprep]
		You let her lift her head so she doesn't pass out, and she screams in pain as you unceremoniously force yourself into her. You feeling the telltale resistance of a tearing hymen as you begin to violate her.[sex][pose|doggyrape][humansound|screaming]
		You hear the sounds of scrambling as her parents come up the stairs, and you pull a knife from your belt. You hold her head up so she can see as they enter, and hold the knife to her throat. You don't need to say anything for the threat to become clear, and they stand in the doorway, frozen.
		You continue for most of the night, vigorously using the girl while you force her inconsolable parents watch from the doorway. Over time, her screams turn to ragged crying, and finally quiet sobs as she loses more and more strength. When the morning light begins to stream through the window, you allow yourself to finish inside her.[humansound|sobbing]
		You pull yourself out of the girl, and she curls up on the bed, sobbing. You casually draw your pistol and shoot them as she looks on, drawing out a fresh scream before she collapses to the bed once again. You can take her with you, leave her here, or finish her off.[sex][macro|postrape][humansound|Scream]
			Keep her
				You grab her by the hair and drag her screaming form through the open window. You see lights turn on in nearby windows as people investigate the screaming, but they know better than to interrupt. You pin her into the restraint chair of your ship and take off, returning to your station with your souvenir.[pose|boundseated]
			Kill her
				You wrap a single hand around her neck and twist it, snapping her spine. Her sobbing abruptly cuts out, and she twitches slightly as you walk out through the open window. You board your ship and return to your station, refreshed from your vacation.[remove][hide]
			Leave her
				You simply get up and leave through the open window. She's not worth the price. You board your ship and return to your station, recharged from your vacation.[remove]
	Maybe another time
		You're too busy for a vacation. Perhaps you can get away another time.

{notvar chronoexperiment}{selectslavebytag insane}Chrono Experiment
[name] is mentally unstable, which limits her value on the open market. You receive numerous offers for experimental treatments, and one in particular has piqued your interest. The researchers offer to strap her into their modified chrono chamber, grant her immortality, and force her to experience eons of time in the span of a few days. The theory is that it could provide enough time for her neurons to reconfigure into something more useful. It's a tempting offer, and her mental state has little room to decline.
	Accept the offer
		You have a security drone drag [name] to the portal, and the researchers depart with the restrained slave. A few days pass before their return, and [name] is following them, surprisingly unrestrained. As they bring her to you, she cocks her head slightly, and begins to speak.
		"The time of the false gods is ending. Your structures of metal and sand will crumble to the stars from whence they came, and Entropy shall stand as a giant atop the ruins. I have seen the form of things to come, and it contains a hole in the shape of the masters."
		The scientist apologizes for the outburst. The experiment was clearly unsuccessful, though [name] appears to be less erratic in her behavior than before, and appears willing to accept your authority, if only to guarantee her survival.[removetag|insane][addtag|corrupted][set|chronoExperiment][obedience|100][fear|-100]
		On his way out, the scientist tells you that he would be happy to take any other slaves for testing. You can now send insane slaves to be "cured" through the inspection screen.
	Refuse
		Science has gone too far this time. You refuse to give [name] up for this insane experiment.

{notvar devilBargain}{var chronoexperiment}{selectslavebytag corrupted}Devil's Dance
A strange woman has arrived on your station. She has somehow managed to bypass most of your security, and there's no record of her arrival. She requests a meeting with you about [name], one of your slaves who spent eons in a chrono chamber to treat her insanity. As the stranger stares into the camera that is acting as your eye, you see the picture flicker and distort around her, as if it's staring into a source of massive electrical interference.
	Accept
		The woman exchanges pleasantries with you as she enters your office. Her speech is unsettlingly distorted, and skips between voices frequently, often mid-syllable. She is far from a passable android, though, based on the incredible amount of energy leaking from her form, you guess that protocol was not her original purpose. 
		Once the basic etiquette is satisfied, she offers an unusual trade. She is willing to give you something she will only describe as "the cutting edge of Entropy, given terrible form" in exchange for [name]. You try to probe deeper, but she is resistant to gentle forms of interrogation, and it's obvious that attempting to capture her would be inadvisable.
			Accept
				Before you can summon her, [name] appears in your office. It appears that she was waiting outside, though she somehow avoided appearing on the thousands of cameras watching the path. She greets the strange woman as an old friend, and they both depart through the gate. Travel logs show no record of their destination, or even that the gate was opened.[remove][hide]
				Moments later, your station reports that a strange new artifact has appeared just outside. Security footage shows no evidence of hyperspace travel, just the sudden presence of the machine. As it arrives, it performs the electronic equivalent of a greeting, and presents itself as a spacecraft. It is not from any known shipyard, and the design is far more advanced than anything you have encountered. If its transmitted specifications are to be believed, it is far more valuable than [name] could ever be, and you get the impression that the true price has yet to be paid.[addartifact|Shadow][set|devilBargain]
			Decline
				You tell the stranger that [name] is not for sale. She nods, apparently prepared for this response, and departs as suddenly as she arrived. As you look through the logs, you see that all footage that contained her was corrupted beyond repair, and the gates show no evidence of her arrival or departure.
	Decline
		Something is off about the woman, and you decline the invitation. She simply nods and walks back through the gate. As you look through the logs, you see that all footage that contained her was corrupted beyond repair, and the gates show no evidence of her arrival or departure.

{notvar devourer}Distress Signal
Your station is picking up a distress signal from a cargo hauler. It's difficult to make out the issue through all of the screaming, but the sound of rending flesh is unmistakable. Whatever did this could be valuable, if slightly dangerous.
	Investigate the signal
		You send a small team of security drones to investigate the signal. Through its eyes, you see the drifting hauler. It doesn't appear to be damaged on the exterior, but there is only one life sign aboard.
		As it enters the airlock, your security drone is greeted by a massive alien creature standing in a pool of the former crew. It barely takes notice of the robotic interlopers, preferring to gnaw on what is barely recognizable as a human torso.
		The creature matches vague records of something called a "Devourer," a rare Xeno known for its near-infinite hunger. It likely escaped during transport to a wealthy collector, but their loss is your gain. The combined efforts of the security drones are enough to contain the creature, and you manage to place it into a cell.
		You can now place the Devourer Cell artifact to use the creature in the Xeno Arena.[addartifact|DevourerCell][set|devourer]
	Destroy the hauler
		You fire a missile at the signal, and it immediately vanishes as the ship is reduced to a fine dust. Something killed the crew, and investigation is not worth the risk.

{notvar sporemother}Dark Colony
A mining colony on a nearby asteroid has just gone dark. It is not uncommon for slavers to raid small colonies like this, but the asteroid still has significant life signs (if anything, more than before, though your sensors are unable to determine the specific number). 
	Investigate the colony
		You send a small team of security drones to investigate the asteroid. On their approach, they see the entire rock coated in strange spores that have adhered to the surface.
		Upon entering, they immediately come face to face with an almost-sapient mass of the strange fungus. This creature matches vague records of the Sporemother Xeno, a rare creature that emits virulent and deadly fungus when not properly contained. It attacks the movement, but the drones are able to contain the beast and place it into a cell.
		You can now place the Sporemother Cell artifact to use the creature in the Xeno arena.[addartifact|SporemotherCell][set|sporemother]
	Vaporize the asteroid from afar
		This is a textbook Xeno event, and you're not about to release whatever did this on the galaxy at large. You send a set of antimatter missiles at the asteroid, reducing it to inert dust.

{notvar defiler}Nature Preserve
A local environmental collective runs nature preserves to keep thousands of rare species from extinction. They always have budget problems, and are trying to keep the lights on by selling one of their rarest specimens. The creature is among the last of the rapacious Defilers, who terrorized local colonists before being all but eradicated.
	Buy the creature (costs $100,000)
		You send a message to the ecologists with the offer, and they quickly accept. Within hours, a ship has arrived at your station with the Defiler in a specially-built cell.
		You can now place the Defiler Cell artifact, which will give you access to the creature in the Xeno arena.[addArtifact|DefilerCell][money|-100000][set|defiler]
	Pass up the offer
		You simply close the notification. You're not in the market for animals.

{extreme}{selectslavebytag fae}{notvar faeHomeworld}Secrets of the Fae
Despite the Fae's presence in many slavers' harems, little is actually known about the strange creatures. They are notoriously secretive, and, despite what appears to be a form of hereditary memory, none have yet revealed the location or nature of their homeworld. You see [name] walking by your desk, looking mischievous as ever, and unknowingly daring you to make yet another attempt.
	Try to extract the information from her (likely fatal)
		Fae brain chemistry rejects neural laces, so a direct probe is unfortunately out of the question. You will have to do this the old-fashioned way. As you look at her, it seems that she can sense your intention, and she immediately bolts for the door. [hide]
		You oversee the security drones' pursuit through the security cameras, but she is moving so fast that she almost seems to dodge in and out of reality as she sprints for the gate room. Her escape attempt proves futile though, and, after a series of near misses, a drone manages to grab her around the waist and lift her into the air. It brings the kicking and screaming girl back to your suite.[show][pose|dronestruggle][humansound|screaming]
		As [name] struggles against the drone, you explain to her that she is going to tell you the location of the Fae homeworld. She refuses, of course, spitting in your face as she does so. This is not going to be easy, but great rewards require great sacrifices. You have the drone pin her to the wall by her hands and feet, and get to work.[humansound|spit][humansound|fear]
		Over the next months, [name] hangs in your office as your plaything. When you are not actively torturing her, you have your drones take over, never giving her a moment of respite. By the end, virtually every part of her has been replaced, repaired, or just broken beyond recognition, and she has clearly been driven insane by the harsh treatment.[pose|torture][humansound|screaming]
		You finally order the drones to stop, and lift her chin and look her directly in the eyes. You explain to her that you will allow her to die if and only if she reveals the location of her homeworld. She has endured far more than any human could, but even Fae have limits. She reluctantly whispers a set of coordinates. Almost before she has finished uttering them, you have confirmed that they point to an uncharted world circling a black hole, the perfect place to hide an entire planet.
		You thank her before wrapping a hand around her neck. She is devastated that she has betrayed her people to the likes of you, but her face freezes into a look of relief as you twist sharply, snapping her spine and killing her instantly. You are now the only outsider who has ever known the location of the Fae homeworld, and you begin preparations for the coming invasion.[set|faeHomeworld][humansound|none][remove]
	Leave her be
		So many have tried and failed. There's no point in wasting a perfectly good slave on a fool's errand.
