Sacrifice
As you sit at your desk, you hear a deafening crack from the space in front of you. When you look up, you see electricity arcing through the air, and a strange woman standing in the center of the anomaly.[macro|avatar][remove]
"Do not be afraid. Destroying you would be counterproductive."
Her speech is unsettlingly distorted, skipping between voices and accents frequently. She is obviously some kind of android, but not one designed with protocol in mind.
"Your people have a saying. Kill one, and you're a murderer. Kill a million, and you're a conqueror. Kill them all, and you're a god."
The android pauses for a moment, and you see her look in the direction of your station's data banks.
"Sacrifice ten billion souls in our name, and we will show you the truth behind those words."
As soon as she finishes speaking, the android snaps out of existence, leaving nothing but the crackle of static electricity in the air.[hide]
You see plans for a "Genocide Stone" planet upgrade appear in your systems. The design is beyond anything you could realistically analyze, but the name makes its purpose clear.[set|genocidestone]
