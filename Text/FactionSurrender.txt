Black Star Mercenary Group
You receive a message from Tyrant.[environment|blackstar][pose|tyrantsit][macro|tyrant][remove]
"Listen. We both know this was isn't going my way. I don't know how, but it's the truth. We keep this up, and I'm eventually going to end up pinned on some backwater moon, making a heroic last stand."
"As appealing as that all sounds, I have a better idea. I've always wanted to try exploring. I'll give you what's left of my holdings. Planets, moons, every scrap of rock under my control. Everything except for one ship big enough for me and a hundred of my best. I stay out of your sky, and you stay out of my way."
"If you don't, I'll send operatives to sabotage your planets, guerrillas to fight your drones, and turn every ship I have left into a fucking nuke on one of your cities. You might win, eventually. You might not. Either way, you'll lose billions of your people, and you'll curse the day you didn't let me go quietly."
"What do you say? Do we have a deal?"
	Accept her surrender

"I know this war isn't going my way. How about this? You can have my entire empire. The whole thing. All I ask is that you give me a ship and let me live out the rest of my life somewhere remote."
"What do you say?"

The Australian Cooperative
You receive a message from Ava.[macro|ava][environment|australia][pose|avasit]
"This… this needs to stop. All of the good that I've done... the lives saved… the slaves liberated… was it really all for this? Billions dead, and for what? I... I can't let this go on..."
"What could possibly be worth… this? All this suffering… all this destruction..."
"I surrender. I'll... be your slave. Just stop killing my people. They didn't deserve this war. They didn't deserve any of this. "
	Accept her surrender

"All I ask in return is an unmarked shuttle, enough money to pay for a new face, and an assurance that I won't be followed. I will live out the rest of my days in exile, in a place where you cannot trouble me, and I cannot trouble you. "

Prime Consumer Electronics
"Was too late. Underestimated growth. Mistook exponential for linear. Won't happen again. Can't happen again. This is over. Has been since it started. Possibly before."[macro|micah][environment|prime][pose|micahsit]

"You will take Prime and prosper in my place. I will continue my work as your slave. No more distractions. No threat of destruction."

The Null Autonomous Collective
You receive a message from the Speaker of the Null Autonomous Collectives.[macro|speaker][pose|speakersit][environment|null]
"This was not supposed to occur. We ran millions of simulations. The outcome was certain. Utilitarianism demanded that we intervene on behalf of your people."
"Yet here we stand. Defeat snatched from the illusory jaws of victory, begging for mercy from the tear in probability."
"You have slaughtered billions of your kind. Brought ruin to countless wonders. Destroyed the very substrate of our civilization. We surrender the ruins to you. All we ask is that you stop the killing."

Shiva Military Corporation
You receive a message from Pari[macro|pari][pose|parisit][environment|shiva][remove]
"I have... underestimated you. I don't know how you did this. I suppose it doesn't matter. My armada is in tatters. My supply lines are cut to ribbons. The inescapable truth is that the greatest military in the galaxy, the wellspring from which all other militaries are born, has been outmatched."
"I suppose we both know where this leads. All I want is to avoid your... proclivities. Everything else is negotiable. You can have my empire. Everything I own. All I ask is that you let me leave her unhindered."
	Accept her surrender
		I suppose this is goodbye then. I would say thank you, but...
