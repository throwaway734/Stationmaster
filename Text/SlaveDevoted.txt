Devoted Slave
[name] has been obedient to you for some time, and you've noticed that she has recently begun to see you as more than her master. During a rare free moment, she approaches you at your desk:
"Master? I... I just wanted to say... You've been so good to us, and... and... I love you. I want to be here with you... for as long as I can..."
	Thank her for her gesture
		You thank her for her words, and tell her that she is a good slave. She runs up and kisses you warmly before sprinting off to make it to her next assignment on time.
		[name] is now devoted, and sees her servitude to you as her life's purpose instead of a duty.[hide]
	Humiliate her
		You barely react, but direct a screen behind you to play back the security feed of her pitiful confession. You then switch the feed to a public area of your station, where she can see the video being played on every screen.
		[name] bursts out crying and sprints out of the room. She feels betrayed enough that she has lost her devotion to you for now, but she will eventually recover.[removetag|devoted]
	Ignore her
		You continue your work without acknowledging her outburst. She waits for a reaction for a moment, but soon realizes that there won't be one. You see her bow and scurry out of the room, sniffling quietly.[hide]
		Despite your reaction, she is now devoted to you, and sees her servitude as more of a pleasure than a duty.
